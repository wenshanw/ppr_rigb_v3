2017/09/13:
1, turns out to be a very good paper explaining the links between factors of different spatial scales!!!
didn't read in details though (the self-organizing method and discussion)
ridging and anticyclone are in the same direction at the high melt nodes --{\textgreater} warm and humid air from south
2, warm and humid air --{\textgreater} more water vapor --{\textgreater} more LW down BUT no more cf!
might be useful for ppr{\_}aws
3, it really solves the conflict btw Hanna (dry) and Shupe (wet)
09/18: not quite sure how now: probably by the scale analysis
(I think I understood much better last time: should write down more)
(har, late-hour work --{\textgreater} not very good...)
Or, dry or wet: it turns out more water vapor but less clouds, since it's warmer and subside

Qs:
1, how to check significance of this method?
2, some of the explanation does make sense to me but most of them do, a much higher ratio than Hofer2017},

abstract = {[1] The objective of this paper is to present the validation over Greenland of a thermodynamic snow-ice model that was complemented with the snow metamorphism and albedo parameterizations of the Centre d'Etudes de la Neige (Grenoble, France) in order to make the surface albedo variable and interactive. Special attention is given to the surface albedo since it is the most important parameter in energy exchanges with the atmosphere for snow and ice melt. The development of an integrated (snow, ice, and water) albedo model takes into account the different surface types observed on an ice sheet, and the snow albedo is calculated from the simulated surface snow grains. The validation for a polar site has been done at ETH Camp (West Greenland, 1155 m above sea level) during the 1990 and 1991 summer seasons. Although both ablation seasons differed greatly (in 1990 it showed a negative mass balance while in 1991 it ended with a positive mass balance), a single model configuration was able to provide good results for both 1990 and 1991. These simulations show that the snow metamorphism laws included enable an accurate simulation of the surface albedo and henceforth of the surface mass balance for a polar site, provided that the snow model is correctly forced at its surface level and that meltwater retention, percolation, and drainage are well represented in the snow model. The model results are also compared with two other modeling approaches, and differences between the three snow models are detailed.},

abstract = {Global-scale variations in the climate system over the last half of the twentieth century. including long-term increases in global-mean near-surface temperatures. are consistent with concurrent human-induced emissions of radiatively active gases and aerosols. However, such consistency does not preclude the possible influence of other forcing agents, including internal modes of climate variability or unaccounted for aerosol effects. To test whether other unknown forcing agents may have contributed to multidecadal increases in global-mean near-surface temperatures from 1950 to 2000. data pertaining to observed changes in global-scale sea surface temperatures and observed changes in radiatively active atmospheric constituents are incorporated into numerical global climate models. Results indicate that the radiative forcing needed to produce the observed long-term trends in sea surface temperatures-and global-mean near-surface temperatures-is provided predominantly by known changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. Further, results indicate that less than 10{\%} of the long-term historical increase in global-mean near-surface temperatures over the last half of the twentieth century could have been the result of internal climate variability. In addition. they indicate that less than 25{\%} of the total radiative forcing needed to produce the observed long-term trend in global-mean near-surface temperatures could have been provided by changes in net radiative forcing from unknown sources (either positive or negative). These results, which are derived from simple energy balance requirements. emphasize the important role humans have played in modifying the global climate over the last half of the twentieth century.},

abstract = {
A 58-year record (1950-2007) of cloudiness measured at 11 ground stations in South Korea revealed that summertime cloudiness for Wednesday through Friday versus that for Saturday through Monday exhibited a bell-shaped curve; the midweek/weekend difference increased up to 6{\%} in the 1960s and early 1970s, and decreased in the mid and late 1970s. Since 1980, the anomaly has become as small as before 1960 (within 2{\%}). This bell-shaped interdecadal variation in midweek/weekend difference in cloudiness had a strong negative correlation with those in insolation and diurnal temperature range and a positive correlation with those in relative humidity and number of days with light rain ({\textless}5mmday-1) from coincident ground measurements. Unlike the meteorological variables, the aerosol concentrations from the stations in the same cities appear to be consistently higher in the midweek than on the weekend in recent years (1990-2004). Therefore, the long-term variations in midweek/weekend differences in cloudiness and relevant meteorological variables suggest that the regional weekly weather variations are unpredictable despite the rapid industrial growth in South Korea in the past few decades. This study discusses plausible interpretations related to aerosol effects.},

abstract = {The precision of the two-layer cloud height fields derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is explored and quantified for a five-day set of observations. Coincident profiles of vertical cloud structure by CloudSat, a 94 GHz profiling radar, and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), are compared to AIRS for a wide range of cloud types. Bias and variability in cloud height differences are shown to have dependence on cloud type, height, and amount, as well as whether CloudSat or CALIPSO is used as the comparison standard. The CloudSat-AIRS biases and variability range from 4.3 to 0.5 1.2-3.6 km for all cloud types. Likewise, the CALIPSO-AIRS biases range from 0.6-3.0 1.2-3.6 km (-5.8 to -0.2 0.5-2.7 km) for clouds 7 km ({\textless}7 km). The upper layer of AIRS has the greatest sensitivity to Altocumulus, Altostratus, Cirrus, Cumulonimbus, and Nimbostratus, whereas the lower layer has the greatest sensitivity to Cumulus and Stratocumulus. Although the bias and variability generally decrease with increasing cloud amount, the ability of AIRS to constrain cloud occurrence, height, and amount is demonstrated across all cloud types for many geophysical conditions. In particular, skill is demonstrated for thin Cirrus, as well as some Cumulus and Stratocumulus, cloud types infrared sounders typically struggle to quantify. Furthermore, some improvements in the AIRS Version 5 operational retrieval algorithm are demonstrated. However, limitations in AIRS cloud retrievals are also revealed, including the existence of spurious Cirrus near the tropopause and low cloud layers within Cumulonimbus and Nimbostratus clouds. Likely causes of spurious clouds are identified and the potential for further improvement is discussed.},

@article{Bruhl2012,
abstract = {Globally, carbonyl sulphide (COS) is the most abundant sulphur gas in the atmosphere. Our chemistry-climate model (CCM) of the lower and middle atmosphere with aerosol module realistically simulates the background stratospheric sulphur cycle, as observed by satellites in volcanically quiescent periods. The model results indicate that upward transport of COS from the troposphere largely controls the sulphur budget and the aerosol loading of the background stratosphere. This differs from most previous studies which indicated that short-lived sulphur gases are also important. The model realistically simulates the modulation of the particulate and gaseous sulphur abundance in the stratosphere by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). In the lowermost stratosphere organic carbon aerosol contributes significantly to extinction. Further, using a chemical radiative convective model and recent spectra, we compute that the direct radiative forcing efficiency by 1 kg of COS is 724 times that of 1 kg CO2. Considering an anthropogenic fraction of 30{\%}(derived from ice core data), this translates into an overall direct radiative forcing by COS of 0.003 W m(-2). The direct global warming potentials of COS over time horizons of 20 and 100 yr are GWP(20 yr) = 97 and GWP(100 yr) = 27, respectively (by mass). Furthermore, stratospheric aerosol particles produced by the photolysis of COS (chemical feedback) contribute to a negative direct solar radiative forcing, which in the CCM amounts to -0.007 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere for the anthropogenic fraction, more than two times the direct warming forcing of COS. Considering that the lifetime of COS is twice that of stratospheric aerosols the warming and cooling tendencies approximately cancel.},

abstract = {Operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals of cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius employ well-known solar reflectance techniques using pre-calculated reflectance look-up tables. We develop a methodology for evaluating the quantitative uncertainty in simultaneous retrievals of cloud optical thickness and particle size for this type of algorithm and present example results. The technique uses retrieval sensitivity calculations derived from the reflectance look-up tables, coupled with estimates for the effect of various error terms on the uncertainty in inferring the reflectance at cloud-top. The error terms include the effects of the measurements, surface spectral albedos, and atmospheric corrections on both water and ice cloud retrievals. Results will deal exclusively with pixel-level uncertainties associated with plane-parallel clouds; real-world radiative departures from a plane-parallel model are an additional consideration. While we demonstrate the uncertainty technique with operational 1 km MODIS retrievals from the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua satellite platforms, the technique is generally applicable to any reflectance-based satellite- or air-borne sensor retrieval using similar spectral channels.},

abstract = {The ESA satellite CryoSat-2 has been observing Earth's polar regions since April 2010. It carries a sophisticated radar altimeter and aims for the detection of changes in sea ice thickness as well as surface elevation changes of Earth's land and marine ice sheets. This study focuses on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, considering the contemporary elevation of their surfaces. Based on 2 years of CryoSat-2 data acquisition, elevation change maps and mass balance estimates are presented. Additionally, new digital elevation models (DEMs) and the corresponding error maps are derived. Due to the high orbit of CryoSat-2 (88° N/S) and the narrow across-track spacing, more than 99{\%} of Antarctica's surface area is covered. In contrast, previous radar altimeter measurements of ERS1/2 and ENVISAT were limited to latitudes between 81.5° N and 81.5° S and to surface slopes below 1°. The derived DEMs for Greenland and Antarctica have an accuracy which is similar to previous DEMs obtained by satellite-based laser and radar altimetry (Liu et al., 2001; Bamber et al., 2009, 2013; Fretwell et al., 2013; Howat et al., 2014). Comparisons with ICESat data show that 80{\%} of the CryoSat-2 DEMs have an error of less than 3 m ± 30 m. For both ice sheets the surface elevation change rates between 2011 and 2012 are presented at a resolution of 1 km. Negative elevation changes are concentrated at the west and south-east coast of Greenland and in the Amundsen Sea embayment in West Antarctica (e.g. Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers). They agree well with the dynamic mass loss observed by ICESat between 2003 and 2008 (Pritchard et al., 2009). Thickening occurs along the main trunk of Kamb Ice Stream and in Dronning Maud Land. While the former is a consequence of an ice stream stagnated ∼150 years ago (Rose, 1979; Retzlaff and Bentley, 1993), the latter represents a known large-scale accumulation event (Lenaerts et al., 2013). This anomaly partly compensates for the observed increased volume loss in West Antarctica. In Greenland the findings reveal an increased volume loss of a factor of 2 compared to the period 2003 to 2008. The combined volume loss of Greenland and Antarctica for the period 2011 and 2012 is estimated to be −448 ± 122 km3 yr−1.},

They provide an opportunity to revisit accuracy estimates of remote sensing products at these latitudes, which are problematic because the melting of snow/ice and lower solar elevation make the satellite retrievals more difficult.A newly developed inference scheme for deriving SWR from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Terra and Aqua) that utilizes updated information on surface properties over snow and sea ice will be evaluated against these ground measurements and compared with other satellite and model products.

abstract = {Despite its importance as one of the key radiative properties that determines the impact of upper tropospheric clouds on the radiation balance, ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) has proven to be one of the more challenging properties to retrieve from space-based remote sensing measurements. In particular, optically thin upper tropospheric ice clouds (cirrus) have been especially challenging due to their tenuous nature, extensive spatial scales, and complex particle shapes and light scattering characteristics. The lack of independent validation motivates the investigation presented in this paper, wherein systematic biases between MODIS Collection 5 (C5) and CALIOP Version 3 (V3) unconstrained retrievals of tenuous IOT (g) varying as a function of effective radius with mean values that are too large. The MODIS retrievals have been brought into agreement with the IR by adopting a new ice scattering model for Collection 6 (C6) consisting of a modified gamma distribution comprised of a single habit (severely roughened aggregated columns); the C6 ice cloud optical property models have a constant g {\~{}} 0.75 in the mid-visible spectrum, 5–15 {\%} smaller than C5. For CALIOP, the assumed lidar ratio for unconstrained retrievals is fixed at 25 sr for the V3 data products. This value is found to be inconsistent with the constrained (predominantly nighttime) CALIOP retrievals. An experimental data set was produced using a modified lidar ratio of 32 sr for the unconstrained retrievals (an increase of 28 {\%}), selected to provide consistency with the constrained V3 results. These modifications greatly improve the agreement with the IR and provide consistency between the MODIS and CALIOP products. Based on these results the recently released MODIS C6 optical products use the single habit distribution given above, while the upcoming CALIOP V4 unconstrained algorithm will use higher lidar ratios for unconstrained retrievals.},

abstract = {Aerosols are formed, evolve, and are eventually removed within the general circulation of the atmosphere. The characteristic time of many of the microphysical aerosol processes is days up to several weeks, hence longer than the residence time of the aerosol within a typical atmospheric compartment (e.g. the marine boundary layer, the free troposphere, etc.). Hence, to understand aerosol properties, one cannot confine the discussion to such compartments, but one needs to view aerosol microphysical phenomena within the context of atmospheric dynamics that connects those compartments. This paper attempts to present an integrated microphysical and dynamical picture of the global tropospheric aerosol system. It does so by reviewing the microphysical processes and those elements of the general circulation that determine the size distribution and chemical composition of the aerosol, and by implementing both types of processes in a diagnostic model, in a 3-D global Chemical Transport Model, and in a General Circulation Model. Initial results are presented regarding the formation, transformation, and cycling of aerosols within the global troposphere.},

The analysis makes use of several additional datasets to help isolate the cloud contributions. The cloud properties inferred from satellite data are found to be about as accurate as the validation datasets available from other sources, but significant improvements are needed for better diagnosis of cloud-radiative feedbacks. Consequently, advances in cloud retrievals from satellite data will be like “new measurement” that have no independent validation. Reconstruction of regional, monthly mean Earth radiation budgets (ERB) from cloud, atmosphere and surface data is also nearly as accurate as can be checked with summaries of other, more direct measurements, improvements require detailed intercomparisons at smaller space/time...},

abstract = {AbstractThe Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) plays a crucial role in the Arctic climate, and atmospheric conditions are the primary modifier of mass balance. This analysis establishes the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and principal determinants of GrIS mass balance: moisture, cloud properties, radiative forcing, and temperature. Using self-organizing maps (SOMs), observations from the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project are categorized by daily sea level pressure (SLP) gradient. The results describe in detail how southerly, northerly, and zonal circulation regimes impact observations at Summit Station, Greenland. This southerly regime is linked to large anomalous increases in low-level liquid cloud formation, cloud radiative forcing (CRF), and surface warming at Summit Station. An individual southerly pattern relates to the largest positive anomalies, with the most extreme 25{\%} of cases leading to CRF anomalies above 21 W m?2 and temperature anomalies beyond 8.5°C. Finally, the July 2012 extreme melt event is analyzed, showing that the prolonged ice sheet warming was related to persistence of these southerly circulation patterns, causing an unusually extended period of anomalous CRF and temperature. These results demonstrate a novel methodology, connecting daily atmospheric circulation to a relatively brief record of observations.},

abstract = {A method of cirrus detection at nighttime is presented that utilizes 3.8 and 10.4 mu m infrared (IR) window brightness temperature differences (dBT) and total column precipitable water (PW) measurements. This technique is applied to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A (AMSU-A) instrument suite on board EOS-Aqua, where dBT is determined from sets of carefully selected AIRS window channels, while PW is derived from the synergistic AIRS and AMSU-A water vapor retrievals. Simulated and observed dBT for a particular value of PW are not constant; several physical factors impact dBT, including the variability in temperature and relative humidity profiles, surface emissivity, instrument noise, and skin/near-surface air temperature differences. We simulate clear-sky dBT over a realistic range of PWs using 8350 radiosondes that have varying temperature and relative humidity profiles. Thresholds between cloudy and uncertain sky conditions are derived once the scatter in the clear-sky dBT is determined. Simulations of optically thin cirrus indicate that this technique is most sensitive to cirrus optical depth in the 10 mum window of 0.1-0.15 or greater over the tropical and subtropical oceans, where surface emissivity and skin/near-surface air temperature impacts on the IR radiances are minimal. The method at present is generally valid over oceanic regions only, specifically, the tropics and subtropics. The detection of thin cirrus, and other cloud types, is validated using observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program site located at Manus Island in the tropical western Pacific for 89 coincident EOS-Aqua overpasses. Even though the emphasis of this work is on the detection of thin cirrus at nighttime, this technique is sensitive to a broad cloud morphology. The cloud detection technique agrees with ARM-detected clouds 82-84{\%} of the time, which include thin cirrus, as well as other cloud types. Most of the disagreements are well explained by AIRS footprint-scale heterogeneity compared to ARM point measurements, cirrus overlying lower-layer water clouds, possible mixed phase microphysics in midlevel clouds, and significant IR channel noise for cold BT scenes over deep convective towers.},

abstract = {AbstractSupercooled liquid water (SLW) layers in boundary layer clouds are abundantly observed in the atmosphere at high latitudes, but remain a challenge to represent in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate models. Unresolved processes such as small scale turbulence and mixed-phase microphysics act to maintain the liquid layer at cloud top, directly affecting cloud radiative properties and prolonging cloud lifetimes. This paper describes the representation of supercooled liquid water in boundary layer clouds in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global NWP model and in particular the change from a diagnostic temperature-dependent mixed-phase to a prognostic representation with separate cloud liquid and ice variables. Data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in Alaska and from the CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite missions are used to evaluate the model parameterizations. The prognostic scheme shows a more realistic cloud structure, with a SLW layer at cloud top and ice falling out below. However, due to the limited vertical and horizontal resolution and uncertainties in the parameterization of physical processes near cloud top, the change leads to an overall reduction in SLW water with a detrimental impact on shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes, and increased 2 m temperature errors over land. A reduction in the ice deposition rate at cloud top significantly improves the SLW occurrence and radiative impacts, and highlights the need for improved understanding and parameterization of physical processes for mixed-phase cloud in large-scale models.},

However, given the chaotic nature of the climate system, what amount of spread in the prediction of an ice-free summer Arctic is inevitable? Based on results from large ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model, we show that internal variability alone leads to a prediction uncertainty of about two decades, while scenario uncertainty between the strong (RCP8.5) and medium (RCP4.5) forcing scenarios adds at least another 5 years. Common metrics of the past and present mean sea ice state (such as ice extent, volume, and thickness) as well as global mean temperatures do not allow a reduction of the prediction uncertainty from internal variability.},

Results show that 3B42V7 exhibits much smaller errors than the real-time product and that the major component of the error associated with both TMPA 3B42 products is random, as the systematic error is almost completely removed by the bias adjustment applied to the two products. A strong dependence of both systematic and random error components on satellite rain rates—with larger error components at larger rain rates—is observed for both s...},

@article{Ebert1993,
abstract = {A one-dimensional thermodynamic model of sea ice is presented that focuses on those features that are most relevant to interactions with the atmosphere, namely the surface albedo and leads. It includes a surface albedo parameterization that interacts strongly with the state of the surface, and explicitly includes meltwater ponds. The lead parameterization contains a minimum lead fraction, absorption of solar radiation in and below the leads, lateral accretion and ablation of the sea ice, and a prescribed sea ice divergence rate. The model performed well in predicting the current climatic sea ice conditions in the central Arctic when compared with observations and other theoretical calculations. Results of parameter sensitivity tests produced large equilibrium ice thicknesses for small values of ice divergence or large values of minimum lead fraction as a result of positive feedback mechanisms involving cooling of water in the leads. The ice thickness was also quite sensitive to the meltwater runoff fraction and moderately sensitive to the other parameters in the melt pond parameterization, a result of the strong dependence of the surface albedo, and hence the net flux, on the surface conditions. To further investigate the physical interactions and internal feedback processes governing the sea ice-lead system, sensitivity tests were also performed for each of the external forcing variables. The model's equilibrium sea ice thickness was extremely sensitive to changes in the downward longwave and shortwave fluxes and atmospheric temperature and humidity, moderately sensitive to the value of the ocean heat flux, and insensitive to values of wind speed, snowfall, and rainfall in the immediate vicinity of the baseline forcing, although significant changes in thickness occurred for larger variations in wind speed and snowfall. Four important positive feedback loops were identified and described: (1) the surface albedo feedback, (2) the conduction feedback, (3) the lead solar flux feedback, and (4) the lead fraction feedback. The destabilizing effects of these positive feedbacks were mitigated by two strong negative feedbacks: (1) the outgoing longwave flux feedback, and (2) the turbulent flux feedback. Considering the strong influence which sea ice has on global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, it is essential that climate models be able to treat these feedback processes appropriately.},

Paper:
1, Use a norwegian ESM
2, compare between emis in Arctic with at mid-lat


Learnt:
1, In order to analyze RF, need to distinguish BC in the air or on the snow; and analyze clearly separately!
2, forcing in W/s; response is tmp change, clouds...
3, focus on surface emission --{\textgreater} but present the 3d distribution or load of BC (nice step!)
4, introduction: methodology part
5, methods: know more about your model: clouds, aerosols and snow part
6, energy budget table (chp 3.3) --{\textgreater} northward heat transport

Questions to ask:
*1, which part is the response spectrum?
2, four perturbed runs?
3, How to decide scaling factor?
off-line, fully coupled: short time
longer time check if linear...

4, direct vs indirect? y both positive (TOA)
*5, how to read cloud fig?

TO my project:
1, other species besides BC
2, check CESM snow model part; I must run coupled model to get the effect of BC on snow
3, to get significant signal, scale the emission
4, seems emission distribution doesn't affect much, as long as it is inside the so called "Arctic Dome" (Dome will change with tmp?)
5, when I compare the effect of shipping going through mid-lat with high-lat, I need to compare the effects in both mid- and high-lat. The two together, which one is worse
6, do I have or need to the size distribution?
7, plot my BC burden
8, how they added to the model and how to be removed; how long; where went ...
9, Do I have RH effect?
10, We need to run longer time since our emission is changing through time too!
11, for my own interest, effects on cloud or interaction
12, compare some part with obs
13, I can run both to test Phil's model
14, TOA vs surface

Early melt onset in spring, triggered by above-normal near-surface air temperatures, contributed to accelerated snowpack metamorphism and premature bare ice exposure, rapidly reducing the surface albedo. Warm conditions persisted through summer, with the positive albedo feedback mechanism being a major contributor to large negative surface mass balance anomalies. Summer snowfall was below average. This helped to maintain low albedo through the 2010 melting season, which also lasted longer than usual.},

abstract = {To study near-surface melt changes over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) since 1979, melt extent estimates from two regional climate models were compared with those obtained from spaceborne microwave brightness temperatures using two different remote sensing algorithms. The results from the two models were consistent with those obtained with the remote sensing algorithms at both daily and yearly time scales, encouraging the use of the models for analyzing melting trends before the satellite era (1958-1979), when forcing data is available. Differences between satellite-derived and model-simulated results still occur and are used here to identify (i) biases in the snow models (notably in the albedo parametrization, in the thickness of a snow layer, in the maximum liquid water content within the snowpack and in the snowfall impacting the bare ice appearance in summer) and (ii) limitations in the use of passive microwave data for snowmelt detection at the edge of the ice sheet due to mixed pixel effect (e.g., tundra or rock nearby the ice sheet). The results from models and spaceborne microwave sensors confirm a significant (p-value Combining double low line 0.01) increase in GrIS surface melting since 1979. The melt extent recorded over the last years (1998, 2003, 2005 and 2007) is unprecedented in the last 50 yr with the cumulated melt area in the 2000's being, on the average, twice that of the 1980's. {\textcopyright} 2011 Author(s).},

This study provides a detailed error analysis of TOA fluxes based on the latest generation of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) gridded monthly mean data products [the monthly TOA/surface averages geostationary (SRBAVG-GEO)] and uses an objective constrainment algorithm to adjust SW and LW TOA fluxes within their range of uncertainty to remove the inconsistency between average global net TOA flux and heat storage in the earth–atmosphere system.

abstract = {International shipping contributes significantly to the fuel consumption of all transport related activities. Spe- cific emissions of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) per kg of fuel emitted are higher than for road transport or aviation. Besides gaseous pollutants, ships also emit var- ious types of particulate matter. The aerosol impacts the Earth's radiation budget directly by scattering and absorbing the solar and thermal radiation and indirectly by changing cloud properties. Here we use ECHAM5/MESSy1-MADE, a global climate model with detailed aerosol and cloud mi- crophysics to study the climate impacts of international ship- ping. The simulations show that emissions from ships sig- nificantly increase the cloud droplet number concentration of low marine water clouds by up to 5{\%} to 30{\%} depending on the ship emission inventory and the geographic region. Whereas the cloud liquid water content remains nearly un- changed in these simulations, effective radii of cloud droplets decrease, leading to cloud optical thickness increase of up to 5–10{\%}. The sensitivity of the results is estimated by us- ing three different emission inventories for present-day con- ditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals that shipping con- tributes to 2.3{\%} to 3.6{\%} of the total sulfate burden and 0.4{\%} to 1.4{\%} to the total black carbon burden in the year 2000 on the global mean. In addition to changes in aerosol chemi- cal composition, shipping increases the aerosol number con- centration, e.g. up to 25{\%} in the size range of the accumu- lation mode (typically {\textgreater}0.1µm) over the Atlantic. The to- tal aerosol optical thickness over the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Northeastern Pacific increases by up to 8–10{\%} depending on the emission inventory. Changes in aerosol optical thickness caused by shipping induced modifi- cation of aerosol particle number concentration and chemical composition lead to a change in the shortwave radiation bud- get at the top of the atmosphere (ToA) under clear-sky condi- Correspondence to: A. Lauer (axel.lauer@dlr.de) tion of about −0.014W/m2 to −0.038W/m2 for a global an- nual average. The corresponding all-sky direct aerosol forc- ing ranges between −0.011W/m2 and −0.013W/m2. The indirect aerosol effect of ships on climate is found to be far larger than previously estimated. An indirect radiative effect of−0.19W/m2 to−0.60W/m2 (a change in the atmospheric shortwave radiative flux at ToA) is calculated here, contribut- ing 17{\%} to 39{\%} of the total indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols. This contribution is high because ship emissions are released in regions with frequent low marine clouds in an otherwise clean environment. In addition, the potential impact of particulate matter on the radiation budget is larger over the dark ocean surface than over polluted regions over land.},

abstract = {Intrusions of warm, moist air into the Arctic during winter have emerged as important contributors to Arctic surface warming. Previous studies indicate that temperature, moisture, and hydrometeor enhancements during intrusions all make contributions to surface warming via emission of radiation down to the surface. Here, datasets from instrumentation at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility in Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) for the six months from November through April for the six winter seasons of 2013-2014 through 2018-2019 were used to quantify the atmospheric state. These datasets subsequently served as inputs to compute surface downwelling longwave irradiances via radiative transfer computations at one-minute intervals with different combinations of constituents over the six winter seasons. The computed six winter average irradiance with all constituents included was 205.0 W m -2 , close to the average measured irradiance of 206.7 W m -2 , a difference of -0.8{\%}. During this period, water vapor was the most important contributor to the irradiance. The computed average irradiance with dry gas was 71.9 W m -2 . Separately adding water vapor, liquid, or ice to the dry atmosphere led to average increases of 2.4, 1.8, and 1.6 times the dry atmosphere irradiance, respectively. During the analysis period, 15 episodes of warm, moist air intrusions were identified. During the intrusions, individual contributions from elevated temperature, water vapor, liquid water, and ice water were found to be comparable to each other. These findings indicate that all properties of the atmospheric state must be known in order to quantify the radiation coming down to the Arctic surface during winter.},

abstract = {The sea ice cover of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas is currently undergoing a fundamental shift from multiyear ice to first-year ice. Field observations of sea ice physical and optical properties were collected in this region during June-July 2010, revealing unexpectedly complex spatial distributions of solar radiation under the melt-season ice cover. Based on our optical measurements of first-year ice, we found the under-ice light field in the upper ocean to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on wavelength, ice thickness, and the areal and geometric distribution of melt ponded and bare ice surfaces. Much of the observed complexity in radiation fields arose because the transmission of light through ponded ice was generally an order of magnitude greater than through bare, unponded ice. Furthermore, while many sites exhibited a consistent, exponential decay in light transmission through both ponded and bare ice surfaces, light transmission under bare ice was also observed to increase with depth (reaching maximum values similar to 5-10 m below the bottom of the ice). A simple geometric model shows these transmission peaks are a result of scattering in the ice and the interspersion of bare and ponded sea ice surfaces. These new observations of complex radiation fields beneath melt-season first-year sea ice have significant implications for biological production, biogeochemical processes, and the heat balance of sea ice and under-ice ocean waters and should be carefully considered when modeling these sea ice-related phenomena.

This issue is addressed by analyzing the uncertainty in the maps of rain rate provided by the ground-validation radar. To look closely at factors that contribute to the uncertain performance of the radar products, this study uses high-quality rainfall observations from several surface sensors deployed during the Texas and Florida Underflights (TEFLUN-B) field experiment in central Florida during the summer of 1998. A statistical analysis of the radar estimates is performed by comparison with a high-density rain gauge cluster. The approach followed in the current analysis accounts for the recognized effect of rainfall{\&}{\#}39;s spatial variability in order to assess its contribution to radar differences from independent reference observations. The study provides uncertainty quantification of the radar estimates based on classification into light and heavy rain types. The methodology and the reported results should help in future studies that use radar-rainfall products to validate the various TRMM products, or in any other relevant hydrological applications.},

Counter-intuitively, the Arctic warming has been strongest in late fall and early winter whilst sea ice reductions and the direct ice-albedo feedback have been greatest in summer and early fall. To reconcile this, previous studies have hypothesized that fall/winter Arctic warming has been enhanced by increased oceanic heat loss but have not presented quantitative evidence. Here we show increases in heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the overlying atmosphere during October{\&}{\#}8211;January, 1989{\&}{\#}8211;2009. The trends in surface air temperature, sea ice concentration and the surface heat fluxes display remarkable spatial correspondence. The increased oceanic heat loss is likely a combination of the direct response to fall/winter sea ice loss, and the indirect response to summer sea ice loss and increased summer ocean heating.},

abstract = {Old-growth forest ecosystems comprise a mosaic of patches in different successional stages, with the fraction of the landscape in any particular state relatively constant over large temporal and spatial scales. The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass⋅ha(-1)⋅y(-1) were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a sawtooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO(2) fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9{\%} of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.},

As Greenland precipitation is modulated by the NAO, ice core-derived accumulation histories are incorporated into multi-proxy reconstructions. New ice core records from Greenland demonstrate that the NAO's influence on accumulation is temporally and spatially variable. The results presented indicate that (1) NAO modulation of accumulation is strongest and most persistent along the west-central side of Greenland, (2) records from central Greenland should be avoided and (3) the spatial character of the precipitation response to NAO variability has been influenced by the 20th century warming in the high Arctic.},

Further analysis suggests that the amplitude of the so-called "weekly rainfall cycle" in the London area is related to wind speed, sunshine duration and the magnitude of the urban heat-island.
The present investigation on daily maximum and minimum air temperature in the London area, over the 20-yr period from April 1949 to March 1969, shows that there was a weekly cycle in the difference between the mean daily maximum temperature in central London and the surrounding rural area, in midsummer (May, June and July). The mean weekly amplitude of the difference in daily maximum temperature was approximately 0.5癈; the lowest mean difference of daily maximum temperature (London minus surroundings) occurred on Thursday and the highest on Sunday. The pattern is significant at the 0.1 per cent level. The weekly amplitude varied inversely as the wind speed.
Although the weekly pattern of daily maximum temperature can be explained by the weekly pattern of air pollution, the results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that thermal convection can be an important cause of the differences between urban and rural rainfall regimes: also, results indicate that wind speed is an important factor in urban heatisland and rain-island phenomena.},

abstract = {Spatial continuous data (spatial continuous surfaces) play a significant role in planning, risk assessment and decision making in environmental management. They are, however, usually not readily available and often difficult and expensive to acquire, especially for mountainous and deep marine regions. As geographic information systems (GIS) and modelling techniques are becoming powerful tools in natural resource management and biological conservation, spatial continuous data of environmental variables are increasingly required. Environmental managers often require spatial continuous data over a region of interest to make effective and informed decisions and scientists need accurate data which are well-distributed across a region to make justified interpretations. However, spatial distribution data of natural phenomena are often collected from point sources. The marine environment in Australia is a typical case, where: seabed mapping, habitat classification, and prediction of marine biodiversity, essential for marine biodiversity conservation, need reliable spatial continuous data of the marine environment. In most of the Australian marine region, such data are not available, and only sparsely and unevenly scattered point samples have been collected. Therefore, spatial interpolation techniques are essential for estimating biophysical variables for the unsampled locations. The spatial interpolation methods, including geostatistics, have been developed for and applied to various disciplines. They are data-specific or even variable-specific. Many factors including sample size, sampling design and data properties affect the estimations of the methods. There are no consistent findings about how these factors affect the performance of the spatial interpolators. Therefore, it is difficult to select an appropriate spatial interpolation method for a given input dataset. This review aims to provide some guidelines and suggestions in relation to the application of the spatial interpolation methods to environmental data by comparing the features of the commonly applied spatial interpolators. Over 40 spatial interpolation methods are briefly described. They fall into three categories, namely: non-geostatistical interpolators (12), geostatistical interpolators (22) and combined methods (8). Many sub-methods or types are also included, for example, 8 stratified methods and 6 types of regression kriging. A list of the methods that are not commonly used is also provided for those readers interested. iv The spatial interpolation methods were developed either for specific disciplines or even for specific variables based on the data properties modelled. Each method has its specific assumptions and features. These features, such as global versus local, exact versus inexact, deterministic versus stochastic, and gradual versus abrupt, are discussed. In total, 26 spatial interpolation methods are compared theoretically and their features are summarised. Commonly used assessment measures are summarised in relation to: 1) the performance of variogram models, 2) the performance of the spatial interpolation methods, and 3) the performance of a spatial interpolation method for datasets with different sample sizes. The criteria used to judge each measurement are also discussed. Two new measurements are proposed and a procedure is developed to compare the results of the performance of the spatial interpolation methods for different variables and from various disciplines. The spatial interpolation methods have been applied to many disciplines. The focus of this review is mainly on comparative studies in environmental sciences. For each of the 51 comparative studies considered, the following information, including the methods compared, sampling design, sample size, area of region studied and the results, is summarised. The performance of 62 methods and sub-methods in the 51 comparative studies is compared. Four types of method groups are identified based on the frequency of their application. Several factors that affect the performance of the spatial interpolation methods are discussed, including sampling design, sample spatial distribution, data quality, correlation between the primary and secondary variables, and interaction among various factors. The impacts of sample density, variation in the data, sampling design and stratification on the estimations of the spatial interpolation methods are quantified using data from 77 cases in 17 reviewed comparative studies. The results show that variation within the data is a dominant factor and has tremendous impacts on the performance of the spatial interpolators. As the variation increases, the accuracy of all methods decreases. Irregular-spaced sampling design and stratification would improve the accuracy of estimation. There is no evidence of the effects of sampling density on the performance of the spatial interpolation methods in this comprehensive comparative study. v A total of 26 commonly used spatial interpolation methods are then classified based on their features to provide an overview of relationships among these methods. These features are quantified and a cluster analysis is conducted to show similarities among these spatial interpolators. They are classified into 10 groups. To provide guidelines for potential users, a decision tree for selecting an appropriate method from the 26 spatial interpolation methods is developed according to the availability and nature of data. Finally, a list of available software packages for spatial interpolation is provided. Some important factors for spatial interpolation in marine environmental science are discussed, and recommendations are made for applying spatial interpolation methods to marine environmental data in Geoscience Australia},

By late 1999 all datasets will be available for the period from July 1983 through December 1997. The most significant changes in the new D-series cloud datasets are 1) revised radiance calibrations to remove spurious changes in the long-term record, 2) increased cirrus detection sensitivity over land, 3) increased low-level cloud detection sensitivity in polar regions, 4) reduced biases in cirrus cloud properties using an ice crystal microphysics model in place of a liquid droplet microphysics model, and 5) increased detail about the variations of cloud properties. The ISCCP calibrations are now the most complete and self-consistent set of calibrations available for all the weather...},

abstract = {We measured the concentration of dissolved carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the water column of the Northeast Atlantic (49 °N, 12 °W), on a cruise of the RV “Meteor” in January 1994 using a purge-and-trap GC/FPD method (Gas Chromatograph/Flame Photometric Detection). Our results show that parts of the ocean can be undersaturated with respect to the overlying atmosphere and that COS is not always vertically distributed homogeneously within the mixed layer. Generally, the COS concentration was correlated with the under-water light intensity and decreased with depth. Deep water contained measurable amounts of COS, suggesting the existence of a non-photochemical production mechanism in addition to the photochemical mechanism operating in surface waters. During daytime, pronounced vertical COS concentration gradients developed. These gradients leveled off during the night probably because of homogenization due to mixing, hydrolytic decomposition, and the absence of photochemical production. Increased mixed layer depths tended to decrease the COS concentration due to downward mixing out of the zone of photochemical production ({\~{}} 25 m). Incubation experiments showed that COS was formed both photochemically and non-photochemically while methyl mercaptan (MeSH) was produced non-photochemically and destroyed photochemically. We calculated non-photochemical and photochemical production and destruction rate constants for MeSH and COS. The correlation of the photo-production of COS and the photo-destruction of MeSH suggests that there is a link between both reactions. Models are presented which describe the COS and MeSH concentrations during the incubation experiments. Laboratory incubation experiments also showed photochemical formation of COS from MeSH.},

abstract = {Though many global aerosols models prognose surface deposition, only a few models have been used to directly simulate the radiative effect from black carbon (BC) deposition to snow and sea ice. Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are -4.4 (-13.2 to + 10.7) ng g(-1) for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and + 4.1 (-13.0 to + 21.4) ng g(-1) for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng g(-1). Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90 degrees N) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W m(-2) and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W m(-2) in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17W m(-2) for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.},

abstract = {Rapid decline in Arctic sea ice cover in the 21st century may have wide-reaching effects on the Arctic climate system, including the Greenland ice sheet mass balance. Here, we investigate whether local changes in sea ice around the Greenland ice sheet have had an impact on Greenland surface melt. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between sea ice concentration, the timing of melt onset and open water fraction surrounding Greenland with ice sheet surface melt using a combination of remote sensing observations, and outputs from a reanalysis model and a regional climate model for the period 1979{\&}ndash;2015. Statistical analysis points to covariability between Greenland ice sheet surface melt and sea ice within Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. While some of this covariance can be explained by simultaneous influence of atmospheric circulation anomalies on both the sea ice cover and Greenland melt, within Baffin Bay we find a modest correlation between detrended melt onset over sea ice and the adjacent ice sheet melt onset. This correlation appears to be related to increased transfer of sensible and latent heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere in early sea ice melt years, increasing temperatures and humidity over the ice sheet that in turn initiate ice sheet melt.},

@article{Conover1966,
abstract = {Abstract Satellite cloud photography occasionally reveals anomalous cloud lines in the form of plumes often 500 km long and up to 25 km wide. These lines, found over the ocean, are composed of liquid particles. Hollow polygonal, convective or thin stratiform, cloud patterns in varying amounts are associated with the lines. Numerous lines within a 10-deg square have been observed which cover up to 4 per cent of the total area. The most likely cause of the cloud lines stems from the exhaust of ocean going vessels. Large numbers of Aitken nuclei form in this exhaust. These are carried upward by the buoyancy of the hot gases and “ships air wake” to form droplets at slight supersaturation. The phenomenon does not appear related to special characteristics of the vessel's power plant but to a critical condition of the atmosphere. As far as is known, this condition may be described as having 1) a convectively unstable layer from the surface to a low-level stable layer, 2) saturation or slight supersaturation near...},

abstract = {Spaceborne lidar observations from the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite provide the first-ever observations of cloud vertical structure and phase over the entire Greenland Ice Sheet. This study leverages CALIPSO observations over Greenland to pursue two investigations. First, the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) observations are compared with collocated ground-based radar and lidar observations at Summit, Greenland. The liquid cloud cover agrees well between the spaceborne and ground-based observations. In contrast, ground–satellite differences reach 30{\%} in total cloud cover and 40{\%} in cloud fraction below 2 km above ground level, due to optically very thin ice clouds (IWC , 2.5 3 1023 g m23 ) missed by CALIPSO-GOCCP. Those results are compared with satellite cloud climatologies from the GEWEX cloud assessment. Most passive sensors detect fewer clouds than CALIPSO-GOCCP and the Summit ground observations, due to different detection methods. Second, the distribution of clouds over the Greenland is analyzed using CALIPSO-GOCCP. Central Greenland is the cloudiest area in summer, at 17{\%} and 14{\%} above the Greenland-wide average for total and liquid cloud cover, respectively. Southern Greenland contains free-tropospheric thin ice clouds in all seasons and liquid clouds in summer. In northern Greenland, fewer ice clouds are detected than in other areas, but the liquid cloud cover seasonal cycle in that region drives the total Greenland cloud annual variability with a maximum in summer. In 2010 and 2012, large ice-sheet melting events have a positive liquid cloud cover anomaly (from 11{\%} to 12{\%}). In contrast, fewer clouds (27{\%}) are observed during low ice-sheet melt years (e.g., 2009).},

The method takes into account two “reliability criteria”: the performance of the model in reproducing present-day climate (“model performance” criterion) and the convergence of the simulated changes across models (“model convergence” criterion). The REA method is applied to mean seasonal temperature and precipitation changes for the late decades of the twenty-first century, over 22 land regions of the world, as simulated by a recent set of nine AOGCM experiments for two anthropogenic emission scenarios (the A2 and B2 scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change).

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of cloud layers has a significant effect on atmospheric radiative heating/cooling distributions. While multiple cloud layers are often observed to occur simultaneously by surface observers, satellite cloud retrieval methodology typically assumes that any individual imager pixel contains a single cloud layer. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a bispectral method that detects imager pixels containing possible cloud overlap when an optically thin cirrus cloud overlies a low level water cloud, with at least a 2-km separation between layers. The method is developed from a scatterplot of the near-infrared 1.63-mu m band reflectances and the 11-mu m brightness temperatures using data from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) airborne simulator (MAS). The bispectral method is applied to a scene recorded by the MAS scanning spectrometer that was flown on the NASA ER-2 during the Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS)field campaign during April and May 1996, For a scene recorded on April 21, 1996, at 2000 UTC, the complex vertical cloud structure was captured by lidar backscatter measurements from the Cloud Lidar System (CLS). The bispectral method appears to have a promising facility for identifying areas containing potential cloud overlap.},

abstract = {Daily rainfall and temperature data of 158 weather stations in eight European countries and Iceland are investigated to set up a weekly cycle. The time series are divided into five time slices that are analyzed separately. As they depend strongly on the data availability, the significance of weekly cycles is generally higher for the past three time slices of 1931-1960, 1961-1990, and 1991-2005 compared to the two earlier analyzed time slices of 1871-1900 and 1901-1930. Precipitation does not follow any distinct significant weekly cycle. For temperature, however, significant weekly cycles exist in all analyzed countries. The weekly periodicities cannot be explained by random effects. A clear weekly signal is detected by means of a stationary block bootstrap approach. The cycles of temperature vary with the region and the time slice. However, they are found to be more stable for the last two time slices. For the dominant pattern of the weekly cycle in Germany, a coinciding significant weekly cycle of the large-scale circulation is detected for the time slice 1991-2005. In Germany, persistence can be observed for the weekday holding the minimum value of the temperature variables. The minimum is observed to occur on Saturday for the past two time slices. When judging from significant results exclusively, most other countries also show persistence for the past two time slices, except for the weekday with the maximum value of the temperature variables. This weekday either is Tuesday for Iceland and the UK or Wednesday for Sweden and Norway.},

abstract = {Surface pollutant concentrations in Mexico City show a distinct pattern of weekly variations similar to that observed in man), other cities of the world. Measurements of the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO+NO2). particulate matter smaller than 10 mu m (PM10), and ozone (O-3) collected hourly over 22 years (1986-2007) at 39 urban monitoring locations were analyzed. Morning concentrations of CO, NOx, and PM10 are lower on Saturdays and even more so on Sundays, compared to workdays (Monday-Friday), while afternoon O-3 concentrations change minimally and are occasionally even higher. This weekend effect is empirical evidence that photochemical O-3 production is NOx-inhibited, and to the extent that emissions of CO are proportional to those of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), it is VOC-limited, at least in the urban areas for which the monitoring stations are representative. The VOC-limitation has increased in the past decade. due to decreases in the concentrations of CO (and presumably VOCs) and consequent decreases in the CO/NOx and VOC/NOx ratios. Enhancements of photolysis frequencies resulting front smaller weekend aerosol burdens are not negligible. but fall short of being an alternate explanation for the observed weekend effect. The strength of the weekend effect indicates that local radical termination occurs primarily via formation of nitric acid and other NOx-related compounds. some of which (e.g. peroxy acyl nitrates) can contribute to the regional NOx budget. While VOC emission reductions would be most effective in reducing local O-3 production. NOx emission reduction may be more important for controlling regional oxidants.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of 12 models to estimate hourly diffuse solar irradiation on inclined surfaces from those measured on horizontal surfaces. Total solar irradiation incident on a tilted surface consists of three components including: beam, diffuse and reflected from the ground. On a semi-hourly basis, the beam component can be calculated by the ratio of the incidence angle to the solar zenith angle. The reflected component has a small effect on calculations and may be calculated with an isotropic model. In contrast, models for estimating the diffuse component show major differences, which justify the validation study that this paper discusses. Twelve models were tested against recorded south- and west-facing slope irradiances at Karaj (35°55′N; 50°56′E), Iran. The following models were included: Badescu [Ba], Tian et al. [Ti], Perez et al. [P9], Reindl et al. [Re], Koronakis [Kr], Perez et al. [P8], Skartveit and Olseth [SO], Steven and Unsworth [SU], Hay [Ha], Klucher [Kl], Temps and Coulson [TC], and Liu and Jordan [LJ]. The relative root mean square error (RMSE), for the south-facing surface ranges from 10.16{\%} to 54.89{\%} for the SO and TC models, respectively. For the west-facing surface, RMSE ranges from 30.71{\%} for the P9 model to 63.53{\%} for the TC model. Statistical indices show that all models produce large errors for the west-facing surface. Statistical indices for the south-facing surface show reasonably good agreement with measured data.},

abstract = {Observations performed in the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet and over the adjacent tundra in the summer of 1991 are described. The experimental area is the region near S{\o}ndre Str{\o}mfjord (67°N, 54°W), which is relatively dry and sunny, resulting in the highest mean temperature in Greenland in July. The katabatic wind is dominantly present over the ice; it influences the energy balance near the surface through the sensible and latent heat flux. With the aid of a tethered balloon it was observed that the thickness of the katabatic layer is typically 100 to 200 m. An interesting aspect of the katabatic wind appears to be the acceleration of the flow in the late afternoon due to the large temperature gradient at the border between tundra and ice. Further on the ice, this effect is no longer important for the dynamics of the katabatic flow. The net radiation is the main driving force there. An attempt is made to estimate the importance of these thermal wind effects compared to the buoyancy forcing. It is concluded that near the edge of the ice surface winds are driven by the horizontal pressure gradient, imposed by the thermal contrast between tundra and ice. A comparison is made between the observed katabatic wind and those in the Antarctic. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {At the turn of the years 2015/2016, maximum surface temperature in the Arctic reached record-high values, exceeding the melting point, which led to a strong reduction of the Arctic sea ice extent in the middle of the cold season. Here we show, using a Lagrangian method, that a combination of very different airstreams contributed to this event: (i) warm low-level air of subtropical origin, (ii) initially cold low-level air of polar origin heated by surface fluxes, and (iii) strongly descending air heated by adiabatic compression. The poleward transport of these warm airstreams occurred along an intense low-level jet between a series of cyclones and a quasi-stationary anticyclone. The complex 3-D configuration that enabled this transport was facilitated by continuous warm conveyor belt ascent into the upper part of the anticyclone. This study emphasizes the combined role of multiple transport processes and transient synoptic-scale dynamics for establishing an extreme Arctic warm event.},

abstract = {A multilevel spectral radiative transfer model is used to develop simple but accurate parameterizations for cloud transmittance as a function of cloud optical depth, solar zenith angle, and surface albedo, for use over snow, ice, and water surfaces. The same functional form is used for broadband and spectral transmittances, but with different coefficients for each spectral interval. When the parameterization is applied to measurements of "raw'' cloud transmittance (the ratio of downward irradiance under cloud to downward irradiance measured under clear sky at the same zenith angle), an "effective'' optical depth tau is inferred for the cloud field, which may be inhomogeneous and even patchy. This effective optical depth is only a convenient intermediate quantity, not an end in itself. It can then be used to compute what the transmittance of this same cloud field would be under different conditions of solar illumination and surface albedo, to obtain diurnal and seasonal cycles of cloud radiative forcing. The parameterization faithfully mimics the radiative transfer model, with rms errors of 1{\%}-2{\%}. Lack of knowledge of cloud droplet sizes causes little error in the inference of cloud radiative properties. The parameterization is applied to pyranometer measurements from a ship in the Antarctic sea ice zone; the largest source of error in inference of inherent cloud properties is uncertainty in surface albedo.},

abstract = {Clouds are an essential parameter of the surface energy budget influencing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) response to atmospheric warming and net contribution to global sea level rise. A 4-yr record of NASA A-Train cloud observations is combined with surface radiation measurements to quantify the WAIS radiation budget and constrain the three-dimensional occurrence frequency, thermodynamic phase partitioning, and surface radiative effect of clouds over West Antarctica (WA). The skill of satellite-modeled radiative fluxes is confirmed through evaluation against measurements at four Antarctic sites (WAIS Divide ice camp and Neumayer, Syowa, and Concordia stations). Owing to perennial high-albedo snow and ice cover, cloud infrared emission dominates over cloud solar reflection and absorption leading to a positive net all-wave cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface, with all monthly means and 99.15{\%} of instantaneous CRE values exceeding zero. The annual-mean CRE at the WAIS surface is 34 W m22 , representing a significant cloudinduced warming of the ice sheet. Low-level liquid-containing clouds, including thin liquid water clouds implicated in radiative contributions to surface melting, are widespread and most frequent in WA during the austral summer. In summer, clouds warm the WAIS by 26 W m22 , on average, despite maximum offsetting shortwave CRE. Glaciated cloud systems are strongly linked to orographic forcing, with maximum incidence on the WAIS continuing downstream along the Transantarctic Mountains.},

abstract = {In this paper, radiative fluxes for 10 years from 11 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and from CERES satellite observations have been analyzed and compared. Under present-day conditions, the majority of the investigated CMIP5 models show a tendency towards a too-negative global mean net cloud radiative forcing (NetCRF) as compared to CERES. A separate inspection of the long-wave and shortwave contribution (LWCRF and SWCRF) as well as cloud cover points to different shortcomings in different models. Models with a similar NetCRF still differ in their SWCRF and LWCRF and/or cloud cover. Zonal means mostly show excessive SWCRF (too much cooling) in the tropics between 20° S and 20° N and in the midlatitudes between 40 to 60° S. Most of the models show a too-small/too-weak LWCRF (too little warming) in the subtropics (20 to 40° S and N). Difference maps between CERES and the models identify the tropical Pacific Ocean as an area of major discrepancies in both SWCRF and LWCRF. The summer hemisphere is found to pose a bigger challenge for the SWCRF than the winter hemisphere. The results suggest error compensation to occur between LWCRF and SWCRF, but also when taking zonal and/or annual means. Uncertainties in the cloud radiative forcing are thus still present in current models used in CMIP5.},

abstract = {The diurnal albedo variation of glaciers on clear sky days can be relatively high due to geometric effects induced by tilt errors. In the present paper, these tilt errors of albedo measurements are corrected in cases where tilts of both, the sensors and the slopes are not accurately measured. For this method of correction, a nearby reference measurement with a horizontally levelled sensor is needed to determine atmospheric parameters. Based on that a model is developed that is fitted to the measured data to determine tilts and directions of sensors and slopes, which vary daily due to changing atmospheric conditions and snow cover. Once these parameters are determined, the albedo, the radiative balance and the energy balance can be corrected. The differences between measured and corrected values show an obvious under- or overestimation of albedo, depending on the direction of the slope. It is also demonstrated that the difference between measured and corrected albedo is highest for high solar zenith angles.},

The simulations are performed with a modified version of The Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), referred to as the Polar MM5. Global atmospheric analyses as well as automatic weather station and instrumented aircraft observations from Greenland are used to verify the forecast atmospheric state. The model is found to reproduce the observed atmospheric state with a high degree of realism. Monthly mean values of the near-surface temperature and wind speed predicted by the Polar MM5 differ from the observations by less than 1 K and 1 m s−1, respectively, at most sites considered. In addition, the model is able to simulate a realistic diurnal cycle for the surface variables, as well as capturing the large-scale, synoptically forced changes in these variables.

abstract = {Infrared radiative processes are implicated in Arctic warming and sea-ice decline. The infrared cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface is modulated by cloud properties; however, CRE also depends on humidity because clouds emit at wavelengths that are semi-transparent to greenhouse gases, most notably water vapour. Here we show how temperature and humidity control CRE through competing influences between the mid- and far-infrared. At constant relative humidity, CRE does not decrease with increasing temperature/absolute humidity as expected, but rather is found to be approximately constant for temperatures characteristic of the Arctic. This stability is disrupted if relative humidity varies. Our findings explain observed seasonal and regional variability in Arctic CRE of order 10[thinsp]W[thinsp]m-2. With the physical properties of Arctic clouds held constant, we calculate recent increases in CRE of 1-5[thinsp]W[thinsp]m-2 in autumn and winter, which are projected to reach 5-15[thinsp]W[thinsp]m-2 by 2050, implying increased sensitivity of the surface to clouds.},

The monthly mean CFs in all reanalyses except JRA-55 are close to or slightly higher than the CC-derived CFs from May to September. However, wintertime CF cannot be confidently evaluated until instrument simulators are implemented in reanalysis products. The comparison between CM and CC CFs indicates that CM-derived CFs are reliable in summer but not in winter.

@article{Stevens2012,
abstract = {This article reviews, from the authors' perspective, progress in observing and modeling energy flows in Earth's climate system. Emphasis is placed on the state of understanding of Earth's energy flows and their susceptibility to perturbations, with particular emphasis on the roles of clouds and aerosols. More accurate measurements of the total solar irradiance and the rate of change of ocean enthalpy help constrain individual components of the energy budget at the top of the atmosphere to within ±2 W m−2. The measurements demonstrate that Earth reflects substantially less solar radiation and emits more terrestrial radiation than was believed even a decade ago. Active remote sensing is helping to constrain the surface energy budget, but new estimates of downwelling surface irradiance that benefit from such methods are proving difficult to reconcile with existing precipitation climatologies. Overall, the energy budget at the surface is much more uncertain than at the top of the atmosphere. A decade of high-precision measurements of the energy budget at the top of the atmosphere is providing new opportunities to track Earth's energy flows on timescales ranging from days to years, and at very high spatial resolution. The measurements show that the principal limitation in the estimate of secular trends now lies in the natural variability of the Earth system itself. The forcing-feedback-response framework, which has developed to understand how changes in Earth's energy flows affect surface temperature, is reviewed in light of recent work that shows fast responses (adjustments) of the system are central to the definition of the effective forcing that results from a change in atmospheric composition. In many cases, the adjustment, rather than the characterization of the compositional perturbation (associated, for instance, with changing greenhouse gas concentrations, or aerosol burdens), limits accurate determination of the radiative forcing. Changes in clouds contribute importantly to this adjustment and thus contribute both to uncertainty in estimates of radiative forcing and to uncertainty in the response. Models are indispensable to calculation of the adjustment of the system to a compositional change but are known to be flawed in their representation of clouds. Advances in tracking Earth's energy flows and compositional changes on daily through decadal timescales are shown to provide both a critical and constructive framework for advancing model development and evaluation.},

Diffuse irradiance is one component of the total downwelling solar irradiance and contains information on the amount of downward-scattered, as opposed to directly transmitted, solar radiation. Additionally, the diffuse component is often required when calibrating total irradiance radiometers. A variety of pyranometers are commonly used to measure solar diffuse irradiance. An examination of some instruments for measuring diffuse irradiance using solar tracking shade disks is presented, along with an evaluation of the achieved accuracy. A data correction procedure that is intended to account for the offset caused by thermal IR exchange between the detector and filter domes in certain common diffuse pyranometers is developed and validated. The correction factor is derived from outputs of a collocated pyrgeometer that measures atmospheric infrared irradiance.},

It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a ?cold clear? state with a strong inversion to a ?warm opaque? state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45{\%} of the surface air temperature and 30{\%} of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

abstract = {The anthropogenically forced decline of Arctic sea ice is superimposed on strong internal variability. Possible drivers for this variability include fluctuations in surface albedo, clouds and water vapour, surface winds and poleward atmospheric and oceanic energy transport, but their relative contributions have not been quantified. By isolating the impact of the individual drivers in an Earth system model, we here demonstrate that internal variability of sea ice is primarily caused directly by atmospheric temperature fluctuations. The other drivers together explain only 25{\%} of sea-ice variability. The dominating impact of atmospheric temperature fluctuations on sea ice is consistent across observations, reanalyses and simulations from global climate models. Such atmospheric temperature fluctuations occur due to variations in moist-static energy transport or local ocean heat release to the atmosphere. The fact that atmospheric temperature fluctuations are the key driver for sea-ice variability limits prospects of interannual predictions of sea ice, and suggests that observed record lows in Arctic sea-ice area are a direct response to an unusually warm atmosphere.},

abstract = {Total cloud fraction over the Arctic (north of 60{\&}{\#}xb0;N) has been evaluated and intercompared based on 16 Arctic cloud climatologies from different satellite and surface observations and reanalyses. The Arctic annual-mean total cloud fraction is about 0.70±0.03 according to different observational data. It is greater over the ocean (0.74±0.04) and less over land (0.67±0.03). Different observations for total cloud fraction are in a better agreement in summer than in winter and over the ocean than over land. An interannual variability is higher in winter than in summer according to all observations. The Arctic total cloud fraction has a prominent annual cycle according to most of the observations. The time of its maximum concurs with the time of the sea ice extent minimum (early summer{\&}{\#}x2013;late autumn) and vice versa (late spring). The main reason for the discrepancies among observations is the difference in the cloud-detection algorithms, especially when clouds are detected over the ice/snow surface (during the whole year) or over the regions with the presence of strong low-tropospheric temperature inversions (mostly in winter). Generally, reanalyses are not in a close agreement with satellite and surface observations of cloudiness in the Arctic.},

abstract = {The integrity of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) radiation monthly averages are assessed by investigating the impact on monthly means due to the frequency of data gaps caused by missing or discarded high time resolution data. The monthly statistics, especially means, are considered to be important and useful values for climate research, model performance evaluations and for assessing the quality of satellite (time- and space-averaged) data products. The study investigates the spread in different algorithms that have been applied for the computation of monthly means from 1-min values. The paper reveals that the computation of monthly means from 1-min observations distinctly depends on the method utilized to account for the missing data. The intra-method difference generally increases with an increasing fraction of missing data. We found that a substantial fraction of the radiation fluxes observed at BSRN sites is either missing or flagged as questionable. The percentage of missing data is 4.4{\%}, 13.0{\%}, and 6.5{\%} for global radiation, direct shortwave radiation, and downwelling longwave radiation, respectively. Most flagged data in the shortwave are due to nighttime instrumental noise and can reasonably be set to zero after correcting for thermal offsets in the daytime data. The study demonstrates that the handling of flagged data clearly impacts on monthly mean estimates obtained with different methods. We showed that the spread of monthly shortwave fluxes is generally clearly higher than for downwelling longwave radiation. Overall, BSRN observations provide sufficient accuracy and completeness for reliable estimates of monthly mean values. However, the value of future data could be further increased by reducing the frequency of data gaps and the number of outliers. It is shown that two independent methods for accounting for the diurnal and seasonal variations in the missing data permit consistent monthly means to within less than 1 W m−2 in most cases. The authors suggest using a standardized method for the computation of monthly means which addresses diurnal variations in the missing data in order to avoid a mismatch of future published monthly mean radiation fluxes from BSRN. The application of robust statistics would probably lead to less biased results for data records with frequent gaps and/or flagged data and outliers. The currently applied empirical methods should, therefore, be completed by the development of robust methods.},

abstract = {A fully coupled meteorology-chemistry-aerosol model (WRF-Chem) is applied to simulate mineral dust and its shortwave (SW) radiative forcing over North Africa. Two dust emission schemes (GOCART and DUSTRAN) and two aerosol models (MADE/SORGAM and MOSAIC) are adopted in simulations to investigate the modeling sensitivities to dust emissions and aerosol size treatments. The modeled size distribution and spatial variability of mineral dust and its radiative properties are evaluated using measurements (ground-based, aircraft, and satellites) during the AMMA SOP0 campaign from 6 January to 3 February of 2006 (the SOP0 period) over North Africa. Two dust emission schemes generally simulate similar spatial distributions and temporal evolutions of dust emissions. Simulations using the GOCART scheme with different initial (emitted) dust size distributions require ∼40{\%} difference in total emitted dust mass to produce similar SW radiative forcing of dust over the Sahel region. The modal approach of MADE/SORGAM retains 25{\%} more fine dust particles (radius{\textless}1.25 $\mu$m) but 8{\%} less coarse dust particles (radius{\textgreater}1.25 $\mu$m) than the sectional approach of MOSAIC in simulations using the same size-resolved dust emissions. Consequently, MADE/SORGAM simulates 11{\%} higher AOD, up to 13{\%} lower SW dust heating rate, and 15{\%} larger (more negative) SW dust radiative forcing at the surface than MOSAIC over the Sahel region. In the daytime of the SOP0 period, the model simulations show that the mineral dust heats the lower atmosphere with an average rate of 0.8 ± 0.5 K day-1 over the Niamey vicinity and 0.5 ± 0.2 K day-1 over North Africa and reduces the downwelling SW radiation at the surface by up to 58 W m -2 with an average of 22 W m-2 over North Africa. This highlights the importance of including dust radiative impact in understanding the regional climate of North Africa. When compared to the available measurements, the WRF-Chem simulations can generally capture the measured features of mineral dust and its radiative properties over North Africa, suggesting that the model is suitable for more extensive simulations of dust impact on regional climate over North Africa. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {The presence of light-absorbing aerosol particles deposited on arctic snow and sea ice influences the surface albedo, causing greater shortwave absorption, warming, and loss of snow and sea ice, lowering the albedo further. The Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) now includes the radiative effects of light-absorbing particles in snow on land and sea ice and in sea ice itself. We investigate the model response to the deposition of black carbon and dust to both snow and sea ice. For these purposes we employ a slab ocean version of CESM1, using the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4), run to equilibrium for year 2000 levels of CO2 and fixed aerosol deposition. We construct experiments with and without aerosol deposition, with dust or black carbon deposition alone, and with varying quantities of black carbon and dust to approximate year 1850 and 2000 deposition fluxes. The year 2000 deposition fluxes of both dust and black carbon cause 1-2 degrees C of surface warming over large areas of the Arctic Ocean and sub-Arctic seas in autumn and winter and in patches of Northern land in every season. Atmospheric circulation changes are a key component of the surface-warming pattern. Arctic sea ice thins by on average about 30 cm. Simulations with year 1850 aerosol deposition are not substantially different from those with year 2000 deposition, given constant levels of CO2. The climatic impact of particulate impurities deposited over land exceeds that of particles deposited over sea ice. Even the surface warming over the sea ice and sea ice thinning depends more upon light-absorbing particles deposited over land. For CO2 doubled relative to year 2000 levels, the climate impact of particulate impurities in snow and sea ice is substantially lower than for the year 2000 equilibrium simulation.},

abstract = {Atmospheric dust is the main aerosol component over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The atmospheric dust over the TP influences climate at local and regional scales through its direct effects on solar and longwave radiation. There are various sources of atmospheric dust over the TP, including the semiarid and arid areas in East Asia as a near source and those in the Middle East and Central Asia and North Africa as remote sources. This study estimates the contributions of these sources to the atmospheric dust over the TP based on a five-year simulation (2010–2014) of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model Coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The contributions of all sources were higher in spring than in the other seasons, with the highest dust loading and concentrations in spring over the TP. The dust in the middle to high troposphere over the TP had diameters varying from 0.04 to 2.5 $\mu$m, showing higher dust number concentrations in spring (at 500 hPa) than in other seasons (at 300 hPa). TP was mainly influenced by East Asian source, which dominated the dust loading over the TP with a contribution of 59–78{\%} in all four seasons. As a result, the East Asian source affected the dust concentration at 500 hPa over the TP by contributing 55{\%} in summer, 44{\%} in autumn, and 27–36{\%} in spring and winter with respect to those of the North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources. The North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources influenced the TP through a mainly northern route in the middle to upper troposphere from Central Asia to the TP. The dust concentration at 300 hPa over the TP was dominated by dust from the North African and the Middle East and Central Asian sources by a contribution of 31{\%}–58{\%} for North Africa and 36{\%} for the Middle East and Central Asia in the four seasons.},

abstract = {Ice–ocean interactions at the bases of Antarctic ice shelves are rarely observed, yet have a profound influence on ice sheet evolution and stability. Ice sheet models are highly sensitive to assumed ice shelf basal melt rates; however, there are few direct observations of basal melting or the oceanographic processes that drive it, and consequently our understanding of these interactions remains limited. Here we use in situ observations from the Ross Ice Shelf to examine the oceanographic processes that drive basal ablation of the world's largest ice shelf. We show that basal melt rates beneath a thin and structurally important part of the shelf are an order of magnitude higher than the shelf-wide average. This melting is strongly influenced by a seasonal inflow of solar-heated surface water from the adjacent Ross Sea Polynya that downwells into the ice shelf cavity, nearly tripling basal melt rates during summer. Melting driven by this frequently overlooked process is expected to increase with predicted surface warming. We infer that solar heat absorbed in ice-front polynyas can make an important contribution to the present-day mass balance of ice shelves, and potentially impact their future stability.},

abstract = {Multi-year ({\~{}}{\&}{\#}xa0;7{\&}{\#}xa0;years) observations of aerosol optical and microphysical properties were conducted at a tropical urban location in Bangalore, India. As a consequence of rapid urbanization, Bangalore presents high local atmospheric emissions, which makes it an interesting site to study the effect of anthropogenic activities on aerosol properties. It has been found that both column (aerosol optical depth, AOD) and ground-level measurements (black carbon (BC) and composite aerosol mass) exhibit a weekly cycle with low aerosol concentrations on weekends. In comparison to the weekdays, the weekend reductions of aerosol optical depth, black carbon and composite aerosol mass concentrations were {\~{}}{\&}{\#}xa0;15{\%}, 25{\%} and 24{\%}, respectively. The magnitude of weekend reduction of black carbon is as much as {\~{}}{\&}{\#}xa0;1{\&}{\#}xa0;{\^{I}}¼g{\&}{\#}xa0;m{\^{a}}{\&}{\#}xa0;3. The similarity in the weekly cycle between the column and surface measurements suggests that the aerosol column loading at this location is governed by local anthropogenic emissions. The strongest weekly cycle in composite aerosol mass concentration was observed in the super micron mass range ({\textgreater}{\&}{\#}xa0;1{\&}{\#}xa0;{\^{I}}¼m). The weekly cycle of composite aerosol mass in the sub micron mass range ({\textless}{\&}{\#}xa0;1{\&}{\#}xa0;{\^{I}}¼m) was weak in comparison to the super micron aerosol mass.},

abstract = {Methane and ethane are the most abundant hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and they affect both atmospheric chemistry and climate. Both gases are emitted from fossil fuels and biomass burning, whereas methane (CH(4)) alone has large sources from wetlands, agriculture, landfills and waste water. Here we use measurements in firn (perennial snowpack) air from Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct the atmospheric variability of ethane (C(2)H(6)) during the twentieth century. Ethane levels rose from early in the century until the 1980s, when the trend reversed, with a period of decline over the next 20 years. We find that this variability was primarily driven by changes in ethane emissions from fossil fuels; these emissions peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at 14-16 teragrams per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g) and dropped to 8-10 Tg yr(-1) by the turn of the century. The reduction in fossil-fuel sources is probably related to changes in light hydrocarbon emissions associated with petroleum production and use. The ethane-based fossil-fuel emission history is strikingly different from bottom-up estimates of methane emissions from fossil-fuel use, and implies that the fossil-fuel source of methane started to decline in the 1980s and probably caused the late twentieth century slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane.},

abstract = {Recent historic observed lows in Arctic sea ice extent, together with climate model projections of additional ice reductions in the future, have fueled speculations of potential new trans-Arctic shipping routes linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, numerical studies of how projected geophysical changes in sea ice will realistically impact ship navigation are lacking. To address this deficiency, we analyze seven climate model projections of sea ice properties, assuming two different climate change scenarios [representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5] and two vessel classes, to assess future changes in peak season (September) Arctic shipping potential. By midcentury, changing sea ice conditions enable expanded September navigability for common open-water ships crossing the Arctic along the Northern Sea Route over the Russian Federation, robust new routes for moderately ice-strengthened (Polar Class 6) ships over the North Pole, and new routes through the Northwest Passage for both vessel classes. Although numerous other nonclimatic factors also limit Arctic shipping potential, these findings have important economic, strategic, environmental, and governance implications for the region.},

abstract = {The strength of snow-albedo feedback (SAF) in transient climate change simulations of the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is generally determined by the surface-albedo decrease associated with a loss of snow cover rather than the reduction in snow albedo due to snow metamorphosis in a warming climate. The large intermodel spread in SAF strength is likewise attributable mostly to the snow cover component. The spread in the strength of this component is in turn mostly attributable to a correspondingly large spread in mean effective snow albedo. Models with large effective snow albedos have a large surface-albedo contrast between snow-covered and snow-free regions and exhibit a correspondingly large surface-albedo decrease when snow cover decreases. Models without explicit treatment of the vegetation canopy in their surface-albedo calculations typically have high effective snow albedos and strong SAF, often stronger than observed. In models with explicit canopy treatment, completely snow-covered surfaces typically have lower albedos and the simulations have weaker SAF, generally weaker than observed. The authors speculate that in these models either snow albedos or canopy albedos when snow is present are too low, or vegetation shields snow-covered surfaces excessively. Detailed observations of surface albedo in a representative sampling of snow-covered surfaces would therefore be extremely useful in constraining these parameterizations and reducing SAF spread in the next generation of models.},

Emphasis is placed on assessing total error over the solar shortwave spectrum from 250 to 4500 nm, as well as supporting investigation over other relevant shortwave spectral ranges. The total measurement error introduced by sensor tilt is dominated by the direct component. For a typical high-latitude albedo measurement with a solar zenith angle of 60°, a sensor tilted by 1, 3, and 5° can, respectively introduce up to 2.7, 8.1, and 13.5 {\%} error into the measured irradiance and similar errors in the derived albedo. Depending on the daily range of solar azimuth and zenith angles, significant measurement error can persist also in integrated daily irradiance and albedo.

In comparison, there has been little improvement in knowledge of the radiation budgets at the surface and in the atmosphere. Based on a simple parameterization, global climatologies of the solar radiation budget at the surface and in the atmosphere are developed from 5 years of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment data and European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts humidity data. Both data sets have global coverage on 2.5° × 2.5° grids. Global distributions of the solar radiation budget at the surface give maximum seasonal values of the net solar radiation for the subtropical oceans of more than 300 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2. The maximum seasonal absorption in the atmosphere is about 120 W m {\&}{\#}8722;2. Shortwave cloud forcing at the surface and in the atmosphere is also derived. Clouds reduce the seasonally averaged surface net solar radiation by up to 175 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2, whereas they increase seasonal net solar radiation in the atmosphere by less than 15 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2. The globally and annually averaged net solar radiation budgets in the atmosphere and at surface are 83 and 157 W m{\&}{\#}8722;2, respectively. Expressed as percentages of the solar radiation incident at the top of the atmosphere, these values correspond to a globally and annually averaged absorption in the atmosphere and at the surface of 24.3{\%} and 46.0{\%}, respectively, and a planetary albedo of 29.7{\%}.},

abstract = {The stability of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice-surface temperature (IST) product from Terra was investigated for use as a climate-quality data record. The availability of climate-quality air temperature data T-A from a NOAA observatory at Greenland's Summit Station has enabled this high-temporal-resolution study of MODIS ISTs. During a {\textgreater} 5-yr period (July 2008-August 2013), more than 2500 IST values were compared with +/- 3-min-average T-A values from NOAA's primary 2-m temperature sensor. This enabled an expected small offset between air and ice-sheet surface temperatures (T-A {\textgreater} IST) to be investigated over multiple annual cycles. The principal findings of this study show 1) that IST values are slightly colder than the T-A values near freezing but that this offset increases as temperature decreases and 2) that there is a pattern in IST-T-A differences as the solar zenith angle (SoZA) varies annually. This latter result largely explains the progressive offset from the in situ data at colder temperatures but also indicates that the MODIS cloud mask is less accurate approaching and during the polar night. The consistency of the results over each year in this study indicates that MODIS provides a platform for remotely deriving surface temperature data, with the resulting IST data being most compatible with in situ T-A data when the sky is clear and the SoZA is less than similar to 85 degrees. The ongoing development of the IST dataset should benefit from improved cloud filtering as well as algorithm modifications to account for the progressive offset from T-A at colder temperatures.},

@article{Doyle2015,
abstract = {Intense rainfall events significantly affect Alpine and Alaskan glaciers through enhanced melting, ice-flow acceleration and subglacial sediment erosion, yet their impact on the Greenland ice sheet has not been assessed. Here we present measurements of ice velocity, subglacial water pressure and meteorological variables from the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet during a week of warm, wet cyclonic weather in late August and early September 2011. We find that extreme surface runoff from melt and rainfall led to a widespread acceleration in ice flow that extended 140 km into the ice-sheet interior. We suggest that the late-season timing was critical in promoting rapid runoff across an extensive bare ice surface that overwhelmed a subglacial hydrological system in transition to a less-efficient winter mode. Reanalysis data reveal that similar cyclonic weather conditions prevailed across southern and western Greenland during this time, and we observe a corresponding ice-flow response at all land- and marine-terminating glaciers in these regions for which data are available. Given that the advection of warm, moist air masses and rainfall over Greenland is expected to become more frequent in the coming decades, our findings portend a previously unforeseen vulnerability of the Greenland ice sheet to climate change.},

We also used mass-concentration data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to study mass change in relationship to surface melt from 2003 to 2006. The mean LST of the GIS increased during the study period by similar to 0.27 degrees C a(-1). The increase was especially notable in the northern half of the ice sheet during the winter months. Melt-season length and timing were also studied in each of the six major drainage basins. Rapid ({\textless}15 days) and sustained mass loss below 2000 m elevation was triggered in 2004 and 2005 as recorded by GRACE when surface melt begins. Initiation of large-scale surface melt was followed rapidly by mass loss. This indicates that surface meltwater is flowing rapidly to the base of the ice sheet, causing acceleration of outlet glaciers, thus highlighting the metastability of parts of the GIS and the vulnerability of the ice sheet to air-temperature increases. If air temperatures continue to rise over Greenland, increased surface melt will play a large role in ice-sheet mass loss.},

abstract = {The interactions that occur between aerosols and a mixed-phase cloud system, and the subsequent alteration of the microphysical state of such clouds, is a problem that has yet to be well constrained. Advancing our understanding of aerosol-ice processes is necessary to determine the impact of natural and anthropogenic emissions on Earth's climate and to improve our capability to predict future climate states. This paper deals specifically with how aerosols influence ice mass production in low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds. In this study, a 9-year record of aerosol, cloud and atmospheric state properties is used to quantify aerosol influence on ice production in mixed-phase clouds. It is found that mixed-phase clouds present in a clean aerosol state have higher ice water content by a factor of 1.22 to 1.63 at cloud base than do similar clouds in cases with higher aerosol loading. We additionally analyze radar-derived mean Doppler velocities to better understand the drivers behind this relationship, and conclude that aerosol suppression of ice nucleation, together with reduced riming rates in polluted clouds are likely influences on the observed reductions in ice water content.},

abstract = {Detailed and accurate vertical distributions of cloud properties (such as cloud fraction, cloud phase, and cloud water content) and their changes are essential to accurately calculate the surface radiative flux and to depict the mean climate state. Surface and space-based active sensors including radar and lidar are ideal to provide this information because of their superior capability to detect clouds and retrieve cloud microphysical properties. In this study, we compare the annual cycles of cloud property vertical distributions from space-based active sensors and surface-based active sensors at two Arctic atmospheric observatories, Barrow and Eureka. Based on the comparisons, we identify the sensors' respective strengths and limitations, and develop a blended cloud property vertical distribution by combining both sets of observations. Results show that surface-based observations offer a more complete cloud property vertical distribution from the surface up to 11 km above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.) with limitations in the middle and high altitudes; the annual mean total cloud fraction from space-based observations shows 25–40 {\%} fewer clouds below 0.5 km than from surface-based observations, and space-based observations also show much fewer ice clouds and mixed-phase clouds, and slightly more liquid clouds, from the surface to 1 km. In general, space-based observations show comparable cloud fractions between 1 and 2 km a.m.s.l., and larger cloud fractions above 2 km a.m.s.l. than from surface-based observations. A blended product combines the strengths of both products to provide a more reliable annual cycle of cloud property vertical distributions from the surface to 11 km a.m.s.l. This information can be valuable for deriving an accurate surface radiative budget in the Arctic and for cloud parameterization evaluation in weather and climate models. Cloud annual cycles show similar evolutions in total cloud fraction and ice cloud fraction, and lower liquid-containing cloud fraction at Eureka than at Barrow; the differences can be attributed to the generally colder and drier conditions at Eureka relative to Barrow.},

Drawing on observations of widespread surface water in Antarctica and decades of study in Greenland, we consider three modes by which meltwater could impact Antarctic mass balance: increased runoff, meltwater injection to the bed and meltwater-induced ice-shelf fracture — all of which may contribute to future ice-sheet mass loss from Antarctica.},

abstract = {The stratospheric aerosol layer has been monitored with lidars at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii and Boulder in Colorado since 1975 and 2000, respectively. Following the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in June 1991, the global stratosphere has not been perturbed by a major volcanic eruption providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the background aerosol. Since about 2000, an increase of 4-7{\%} per year in the aerosol backscatter in the altitude range 20-30 km has been detected at both Mauna Loa and Boulder. This increase is superimposed on a seasonal cycle with a winter maximum that is modulated by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in tropical winds. Of the three major causes for a stratospheric aerosol increase: volcanic emissions to the stratosphere, increased tropical upwelling, and an increase in anthropogenic sulfur gas emissions in the troposphere, it appears that a large increase in coal burning since 2002, mainly in China, is the likely source of sulfur dioxide that ultimately ends up as the sulfate aerosol responsible for the increased backscatter from the stratospheric aerosol layer. The results are consistent with 0.6-0.8{\%} of tropospheric sulfur entering the stratosphere. Citation: Hofmann, D., J. Barnes, M. O'Neill, M. Trudeau, and R.

Southern California's climate warmed at the surface, the precipitation variability increased, and the amount of snow decreased during the 30-year period preceding the second survey. We found that the average elevation of the dominant plant species rose by approximately 65 m between the surveys. This shift cannot be attributed to changes in air pollution or fire frequency and appears to be a consequence of changes in regional climate.},

abstract = {The gradual discovery that late Neoproterozoic ice sheets extended to sea level near the equator poses a palaeoenvironmental conundrum. Was the Earth's orbital obliquity {\textgreater} 60degrees (making the tropics colder than the poles) for 4.0 billion years following the lunar-forming impact, or did climate cool globally for some reason to the point at which runaway ice-albedo feedback created a 'snowball' Earth? The high-obliquity hypothesis does not account for major features of the Neoproterozoic glacial record such as the abrupt onsets and terminations of discrete glacial events, their close association with large ({\textgreater} 10parts per thousand) negative delta(13) C shifts in seawater proxies, the deposition of strange carbonate layers ('cap carbonates') globally during post-glacial sea-level rise, and the return of large sedimentary iron formations, after a 1.1 billion year hiatus, exclusively during glacial events. A snowball event, on the other hand, should begin and end abruptly, particularly at lower latitudes. It should last for millions of years, because outgassing must amass an intense greenhouse in order to overcome the ice albedo. A largely ice-covered ocean should become anoxic and reduced iron should be widely transported in solution and precipitated as iron formation wherever oxygenic photosynthesis occurred, or upon deglaciation. The intense greenhouse ensures a transient post-glacial regime of enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering, which should drive a flux of alkalinity that could quantitatively account for the world-wide occurrence of cap carbonates. The resulting high rates of carbonate sedimentation, coupled with the kinetic isotope effect of transferring the CO2 burden to the ocean, should drive down the delta(13)C of seawater, as is observed. If cap carbonates are the 'smoke' of a snowball Earth, what was the 'gun'? In proposing the original Neoproterozoic snowball Earth hypothesis, Joe Kirschvink postulated that an unusual preponderance of land masses in the middle and low latitudes, consistent with palaeomagnetic evidence, set the stage for snowball events by raising the planetary albedo. Others had pointed out that silicate weathering would most likely be enhanced if many continents were in the tropics, resulting in lower atmospheric CO2 and a colder climate. Negative delta(13)C shifts of 10-20parts per thousand precede glaciation in many regions, giving rise to speculation that the climate was destabilized by a growing dependency on greenhouse methane, stemming ultimately from the same unusual continental distribution. Given the existing palaeomagnetic, geochemical and geological evidence for late Neoproterozoic climatic shocks without parallel in the Phanerozoic, it seems inevitable that the history of life was impacted, perhaps profoundly so.},

Ground-based, remote-sensing observations of mixed-phase clouds can contribute a significant body of knowledge with which to better understand, and thereby more accurately model, clouds and their phase-defining processes.

Time series of daily elemental carbon measurements at various urban locations have been evaluated with the corresponding power spectra. Typical and well-known periodicities caused by anthropogenic and meteorological influences have been identified using coherence and phase spectra. It will be shown that domestic heating by coal combustion appears as a 365 day periodicity, traffic contributes 3.5, 4.6 and 7 day peaks in the spectrum and elevated long range elemental carbon can be identified as characteristic peaks with periodicities in the range from 13 to 42 days. As the relative amplitudes of the various influences vary depending on the location of the measurement site in the urban area, the use of estimated power spectra helps to find the influence of traffic, domestic coal-heating and long range transport on the elemental carbon concentration.},

Ice-sheet discharge was not explicitly included in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, so effects on climate from this melt are not currently captured in the simulations most commonly used to inform governmental policy. Here we show, using simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets constrained by satellite-based measurements of recent changes in ice mass, that increasing meltwater from Greenland will lead to substantial slowing of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and that meltwater from Antarctica will trap warm water below the sea surface, creating a positive feedback that increases Antarctic ice loss. In our simulations, future ice-sheet melt enhances global temperature variability and contributes up to 25 centimetres to sea level by 2100. However, uncertainties in the way in which future changes in ice dynamics are modelled remain, underlining the need for continued observations and comprehensive multi-model assessments.},

abstract = {Temperature inversions are one of the dominant features of the Arctic atmosphere and play a crucial role in various processes by controlling the transfer of mass and moisture fluxes through the lower troposphere. It is therefore essential that they are accurately quantified, monitored and simulated as realistically as possible over the Arctic regions. In the present study, the characteristics of inversions in terms of frequency and strength are quantified for the entire Arctic Ocean for summer and winter seasons of 2003 to 2008 using the AIRS data for the clear-sky conditions. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the inversion strength are also presented for every summer and winter month.
Our analysis shows that although the inversion frequency along the coastal regions of Arctic decreases from June to August, inversions are still seen in almost each profile retrieved over the inner Arctic region. In winter, inversions are ubiquitous and are also present in every profile analysed over the inner Arctic region. When averaged over the entire study area (70 degrees N-90 degrees N), the inversion frequency in summer ranges from 69 to 86{\%} for the ascending passes and 72-86{\%} for the descending passes. For winter, the frequency values are 88-91{\%} for the ascending passes and 89-92{\%} for the descending passes of AIRS/AQUA. The PDFs of inversion strength for the summer months are narrow and right-skewed (or positively skewed), while in winter, they are much broader. In summer months, the mean values of inversion strength for the entire study area range from 2.5 to 3.9 K, while in winter, they range from 7.8 to 8.9 K. The standard deviation of the inversion strength is double in winter compared to summer. The inversions in the summer months of 2007 were very strong compared to other years. The warming in the troposphere of about 1.5-3.0K vertically extending up to 400 hPa was observed in the summer months of 2007.},

abstract = {Albedo - a primary control on surface melt - varies considerably across the Greenland Ice Sheet yet the specific surface types that comprise its dark zone remain unquantified. Here we use UAV imagery to attribute seven distinct surface types to observed albedo along a 25 km transect dissecting the western, ablating sector of the ice sheet. Our results demonstrate that distributed surface impurities - an admixture of dust, black carbon and pigmented algae - explain 73{\%} of the observed spatial variability in albedo and are responsible for the dark zone itself. Crevassing and supraglacial water also drive albedo reduction but due to their limited extent, explain just 12 and 15{\%} of the observed variability respectively. Cryoconite, concentrated in large holes or fluvial deposits, is the darkest surface type but accounts for {\textless}1{\%} of the area and has minimal impact. We propose that the ongoing emergence and dispersal of distributed impurities, amplified by enhanced ablation and biological activity, will drive future expansion of Greenland's dark zone.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of former ice sheets is important for testing Earth system models that can assess interactions between polar ice sheets and global climate, but information retrieved from contemporary glaciated margins is sparse. In particular, we need to know when ice sheets began to form marine outlets and the mechanisms by which they advance and retreat over timescales from decades to millions of years. Here, we use a dense grid of high-quality two-dimensional seismic reflection data to examine the stratigraphy and evolution of glacial outlets, or palaeo-ice streams, that drained the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet into Baffin Bay. Seismic horizons are partly age constrained by correlation with cores from drill sites. Progradational units separated by onlap surfaces record 11 major phases of shelf-edge ice advance and subsequent transgression since the first ice-sheet expansion 3.3–2.6 million years ago. The glacial outlet system appears to have developed in four stages, each potentially caused by tectonic and climatic changes. We infer that an abrupt change in ice-flow conditions occurred during the mid-Pleistocene transition, about 1 million years ago, when ice movement across the shelf margin changed from widespread to a more focused flow (ice streams), forming the present-day glacial troughs.},

abstract = {Abstract A numerical model for the simulation of sea ice circulation and thickness over a seasonal cycle is presented. This model is used to investigate the effects of ice dynamics on Arctic ice thickness and air-sea heat flux characteristics by carrying out several numerical simulations over the entire Arctic Ocean region. The essential idea in the model is to couple the dynamics to the ice thickness characteristics by allowing the ice interaction to become stronger as the ice becomes thicker and/or contains a lower areas percentage of thin ice. The dynamics in turn causes high oceanic heat losses in regions of ice divergence and reduced heat losses in regions of convergence. TO model these effects consistently the ice is considered to interact in a plastic manner with the plastic strength chosen to depend on the ice thickness and concentration. The thickness and concentration, in turn, evolve according to continuity equations which include changes in ice mass and percent of open water due to advection, ...},

abstract = {In recent decades, the Greenland ice sheet has experienced increased surface melt. However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here it is shown that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. The authors find a positive feedback between the variability in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and melt area of the summer Greenland ice sheet, which affects the Greenland ice sheet mass balance. This linkage may improve the projections of changes in the global sea level and thermohaline circulation.},

abstract = {Statistical analyses of data from 12 German meteorological stations meeting WMO standards in the period 1991 - 2005 are presented. These stations represent different local climate conditions in terms of both meteorology and pollution situation. For the average over data of all stations, we identified significant weekly periodicities in many variables such as temperature, daily temperature range, sunshine duration, cloud amount, precipitation, and precipitation frequency. Not only data of stations situated in congested urban areas, but also data of remote stations as e. g. on Mount Zugspitze 2960 m above sea level in the Alps showed significant in-phase weekly cycles. These weekly periodicities cannot be explained completely by local pollution effects or local heat emissions. We tend towards the hypothesis that the anthropogenic weekly emission cycle and the subsequent aerosol cycle interact with the atmospheric dynamics on a larger scale which leads to a forcing of a naturally existing 7-day period among the spectrum of atmospheric periods.},

abstract = {This study integrates global data sets for aerosols, cloud physical properties, and shortwave radiation fluxes with a Monte Carlo Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation (MACR) model to estimate both the surface and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) solar radiation budget as well as atmospheric column solar absorption. The study also quantifies the radiative forcing of aerosols and that of clouds. The observational input to MACR includes data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) for aerosol optical depths, single scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors; satellite retrieved column water vapor amount; the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS) total ozone amount; and cloud fraction and cloud optical depth from the Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) cloud data. The present radiation budget estimates account for the diurnal variation in cloud properties. The model was validated against instantaneous, daily and monthly solar fluxes from the ground-based Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) network, the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) surface solar flux data, and CERES TOA measurements. The agreement between simulated and observed values are within experimental errors, for all of the cases considered here: instantaneous fluxes and monthly mean fluxes at stations around the world and TOA fluxes and cloud forcing for global annual mean and zonal mean fluxes; in addition the estimated aerosol forcing at TOA also agrees with other observationally derived estimates. Overall, such agreements suggest that global data sets of aerosols and cloud parameters released by recent satellite experiments (MISR, MODIS and CERES) meet the required accuracy to use them as input to simulate the radiative fluxes within instrumental errors. Last, the atmospheric solar absorption derived in this study should be treated as an improved estimate when compared with earlier published studies. The main source of improvement in the present estimate is the use of global distribution of observed parameters for model input such as aerosols and clouds. The agreement between simulated and observed solar fluxes at the surface supports our conclusion that the present estimate is an improvement over previous studies. MACR with the global input data was used to simulate the global and regional solar radiation budget, aerosol radiative forcing and cloud radiative forcing for a 3-year period from 2000 to 2002. We estimate the planetary albedo for a 3-year average to be 28.9 +/- 1.2{\%} to be compared with CERES estimate of 28.6{\%} and ERBE's estimate of 29.6{\%}. Without clouds ( including aerosols) the planetary albedo is only 15.0 +/- 0.6{\%}. The global mean TOA shortwave cloud forcing is -47.5 +/- 4 W m(-2), comparing well with the CERES and ERBE estimates of -46.5 and -48 W m(-2), respectively. The clear-sky atmospheric absorption is 72 +/- 3 W m(-2), and the surface absorption is 218 +/- 4 W m(-2). Clouds in all-sky conditions enhance atmospheric absorption from 72 +/- 3 W m(-2) to 79 +/- 5 W m(-2) and decrease surface solar absorption from 218 +/- 4 W m(-2) to 164 +/- 6 W m(-2). The present estimate of 79 W m(-2) for all-sky solar absorption is much larger than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) values of about 67 W m(-2). Most of the increased atmospheric solar absorption is due to improved treatment of aerosol absorption (backed by surface based aerosol network and chemical transport models) and water vapor spectoscopic data. The global mean clear-sky aerosol (both natural and anthropogenic) radiative forcing at the TOA and the surface are -6.0 +/- 1 W m(-2) and -11.0 +/- 2 W m(-2), respectively. In the presence of clouds the aerosol radiative forcing is -3.0 +/- 1 W m(-2) (at TOA) and -7.0 +/- 2 W m(-2) (at the surface). The study also documents the significant regional variations in the solar radiation budget and radiative forcing of aerosols and clouds.},

We approximated the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem respiration to air temperature (Q(10)) across 60 FLUXNET sites with the use of a methodology that circumvents confounding effects. Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest that Q(10) is independent of mean annual temperature, does not differ among biomes, and is confined to values around 1.4 +/- 0.1. The strong relation between photosynthesis and respiration, by contrast, is highly variable among sites. The results may partly explain a less pronounced climate-carbon cycle feedback than suggested by current carbon cycle climate models.},

abstract = {Recent production of land surface anisotropy, diffuse bihemispherical (white-sky) albedo, and direct-beam directional hemispherical (black-sky) albedo from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Terra and Aqua satellite platforms have provided researchers with unprecedented spatial, spectral, and temporal information on the land surface's radiative characteristics. Cloud cover, which curtails retrievals, and the presence of ephemeral and seasonal snow limit the snow-free data to approximately half the global land surfaces on an annual equal-angle basis. This precludes the MOD43B3 albedo products from being used in some remote sensing and ground-based applications, climate models, and global change research projects. An ecosystem-dependent temporal interpolation technique is described that has been developed to fill missing or seasonally snow-covered data in the official MOD43B3 albedo product. The method imposes pixel-level and local regional ecosystem-dependent phenological behavior onto retrieved pixel temporal data in such a way as to maintain pixel-level spatial and spectral detail and integrity. The phenological curves are derived from statistics based on the MODIS MOD12Q1 IGBP land cover classification product geolocated with the MOD43B3 data. The resulting snow-free value-added products provide the scientific community with spatially and temporally complete global white- and black-sky surface albedo maps and statistics. These products are stored on 1-min and coarser resolution equal-angle grids and are computed for the first seven MODIS wavelengths, ranging from 0.47-2.1 $\mu$m and for three broadband wavelengths 0.3-0.7, 0.3-5.0, and 0.7-5.0 $\mu$m.},

abstract = {Past estimates of Greenland Ice Sheet accumulation rates have been multiyear climatologies based on ice/firn cores and coastal precipitation records. Existing annually resolved estimates have incompletely quantified uncertainty, owing primarily to incomplete spatial coverage. This study improves upon these shortcomings by calibrating annual (1958–2007) solid precipitation output from the Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model modified for polar climates (Polar MM5) using firn core and meteorological station data. The calibration employs spatial interpolation of regionally derived linear correction functions. Residual uncertainties exhibit coherent spatial patterns, which are modeled via spatial interpolation of root mean squared errors. Mean 1958–2007 Greenland Ice Sheet annual accumulation rate is 337 ± 48 mm/yr water equivalent (w.e.) or 591 ± 83 Gt/yr. Annual estimates contain one standard deviation uncertainties of 74 mm/yr w.e., 22{\%}, or 129 Gt/yr. Accumulation rates in southeast Greenland are found to exceed 2000 mm/yr w.e. and to dominate interannual variability in Greenland Ice Sheet total accumulated mass, representing 31{\%} of the whole. Accumulation rates in the southeast are of sufficient magnitude to affect the sign of Greenland mass balance during some years. The only statistically significant temporal change in total ice sheet accumulation in the 1958–2007 period occurred between 1960 and 1972, when a simultaneous accumulation increase and decrease occurred in west and east Greenland, respectively. No statistically significant uniform change in ice sheet-wide accumulation is evident after 1972. However, regional changes do occur, including an accumulation increase on the west coast post-1992. The high accumulation rates of 2002–2003 appear to be confined to the southeast.},

abstract = {Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

I buy the theory.

--{\textgreater} still feel the same way


Learnt:
1, diagnostic analysis methods
2, how to include all factors about the circulation both in the atm and the ocean
3, abstract can be more intriguing
3, must be great efforts to compare the present with the history

2017-09-13:
1, diff from Hanna and Fettweis: dry or humid air? should be easy to find out (check Fettweis's sci paper)
both this and Hanna2014 analyzed possible paths of transportation but does the humidity increaes or not?
2, still I don't 100{\%} believe it since it's just simultaneous not necessarily causal
3, take-home:
heat from NA continent + water vapor from atm rivers
didn't get the detailed analysis...
4, I think these oscillation index are phynomena not drivers? like there must be something to drive ENSO and the positive/negative phase of ENSO represent a set of atm/ocn conditions
well, just my own understanding
5, thin liquid cloud and aloft warm air
my Q: elevated relative to what? or meaning more?
6, not 100{\%} consistent: eg, high water vapor stream moves away on July 12; AO signal on July 29
but it's possible that the system is complicated --{\textgreater} these are major causes but not all
7, still it's about the southern Greenland (included Summit) but not the northern part, which was exceptionally warm as well.
8, still like: could give a very low score for this one since I am not in the field},

The seasonal melt departure (SMD), the sum from 1 June to 31 August of the departure from average of each day's melt extent, is a new metric used to describe the amount of melt. Results show a large increase in melt in summer 2007, 60{\%} more than the previous high in 1998. During summer 2007, some locations south of 70 degrees N had as many as 50 more days of melt than average. Melt occurred as much as 30 days earlier than average. The SMD is shown to be significantly related to temperatures at coastal meteorological stations, although 2007 had more melt than might be expected based on the summer temperature record.},

abstract = {Abstract The simulation of Arctic cloud cover and the sensitivity of Arctic climate to cloud changes are investigated using an atmosphere–mixed-layer ocean GCM (GENESIS2). The model is run with and without changes in three-dimensional cloud fraction under 2 × CO2 radiative forcing. This model was chosen in part because of its relatively successful representation of modern Arctic cloud cover, a trait attributable to the parameterized treatment of mixed-phase microphysics. Simulated modern Arctic cloud fraction is insensitive to model biases in surface boundary conditions (SSTs and sea ice distribution), but the modeled Arctic climate is sensitive to high-frequency cloud variability. When forced with increased CO2 the model generally simulates more (less) vertically integrated cloudiness in high (low) latitudes. In the simulation without cloud feedbacks, cloud fraction is fixed at its modern control value at all grid points and all levels while CO2 is doubled. Compared with this fixed-cloud experiment, the ...},

abstract = {A combined analysis of remote sensing observations, regional climate model (RCM) outputs and reanalysis data over the Greenland ice sheet provides evidence that multiple records were set during summer 2012. Melt extent was the largest in the satellite era (extending up to similar to 97{\%} of the ice sheet) and melting lasted up to similar to 2 months longer than the 1979-2011 mean. Model results indicate that near surface temperature was similar to 3 standard deviations (sigma) above the 1958-2011 mean, while surface mass balance (SMB) was sigma 3 below the mean and runoff was 3.9 sigma above the mean over the same period. Albedo, exposure of bare ice and surface mass balance also set new records, as did the total mass balance with summer and annual mass changes of, respectively, -627 Gt and -574 Gt, 2 sigma below the 2003-2012 mean. We identify persistent anticyclonic conditions over Greenland associated with anomalies in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), changes in surface conditions (e. g., albedo, surface temperature) and preconditioning of surface properties from recent extreme melting as major driving mechanisms for the 2012 records. Less positive if not increasingly negative SMB will likely occur should these characteristics persist.},

abstract = {Spaceborne lidar observations from the CloudAerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite are used to evaluate cloud amount and cloud phase in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the atmospheric component of a widely used stateoftheart global coupled climate model (Community Earth System Model). By embedding a lidar simulator within CAM5, the idiosyncrasies of spaceborne lidar cloud detection and phase assignment are replicated. As a result, this study makes scaleaware and definitionaware comparisons between modelsimulated and observed cloud amount and cloud phase. In the global mean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud and excessive ice cloud when compared to CALIPSO observations. Over the icecovered Arctic Ocean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud in all seasons. Having important implications for projections of future sea level rise, a liquid cloud deficit contributes to a cold bias of 2–3°C for summer daily maximum nearsurface air temperatures at Summit, Greenland. Over the midlatitude storm tracks, CAM5 has excessive ice cloud and insufficient liquid cloud. Storm track cloud phase biases in CAM5 maximize over the Southern Ocean, which also has largerthanobserved seasonal variations in cloud phase. Physical parameter modifications reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint. The results also highlight the importance of using a regimebased, as opposed to a geographicbased, model evaluation approach. More generally, the results demonstrate the importance and value of simulatorenabled comparisons of cloud phase in models used for future climate projection.},

abstract = {We present the summertime daily cycle of the Antarctic surface energy balance (SEB) and its sensitivity to cloud cover. We use data of automatic weather stations (AWS) located in four major Antarctic climate zones: the coastal ice shelf, the coastal and interior katabatic wind zone and the interior plateau. Absorbed short wave radiation drives the daily cycle of the SEB, in spite of the high surface albedo (0.84-0.88). The dominant heat sink is the cooling by long wave radiation, but this flux is distributed more evenly throughout the day so that a pronounced daily cycle in net all-wave radiation remains with all-sky night-time heat losses of 20-30 W m-2 and noontime heat gains of 30-40 W m-2. During the night, heat is re-supplied to the snow surface by the sensible heat flux, especially in the katabatic wind zone, and the sub-surface heat flux. Daytime radiative energy excess is removed from the surface by sublimation (except at the high plateau) and sub-surface heat transport. Daytime convection occurs at all sites around solar noon but is generally weak. Spatial differences in the SEB are largely controlled by differences in cloud cover. Clouds are associated with higher surface temperatures and near-surface wind speeds. This especially limits nocturnal cooling, so that the strongest daytime convection is found during overcast conditions on the interior plateau. Copyright 2006 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The surface energy budget and ablation were measured in the ablation zone of Parlung No. 4 Glacier on the southeast Tibetan Plateau (29 degrees 14'N, 96 degrees 55'E) during boreal summer 2009. The present study examines the summertime surface energy fluxes to identify major atmospheric variables governing the surface melt and their phenomenological links to the progression of the South Asian monsoon. Turbulent sensible heat and latent heat fluxes were calculated using the bulk aerodynamic approach, the accuracy of which was verified through a comparison with eddy-covariance flux measurements. The surface ablation calculated by the energy balance model was also verified by measurements of ablation stakes. Our results found the following percentage contributions to the total melt energy: net shortwave radiation, 98{\%}; net longwave radiation, -12{\%}; sensible heat, 16{\%}; latent heat, -1{\%}; and subsurface fluxes, -1{\%}. The combined roles of cloud cover and surface albedo appear to control the surface energy balance during the onset period of the South Asian monsoon. The cloud variations affect surface melting with the advancement of the monsoon. Intensification of the South Asian monsoon probably accelerates melting in the ablation zone, whereas weakening of the monsoon reduces glacier melting, mainly because of changes in downward longwave irradiance and heat release due to vapor condensation. Moreover, the temperature index model proves useful for long-term mass balance and ablation modeling in cases where the degree-day factors are calibrated. But incorporating incoming shortwave radiation into the model should be more applicable and practical in this region.},

abstract = {The variation of snow albedo with wavelength across the solar spectrum from 0.3 $\mu$m in the ultraviolet (UV) to 2.5 $\mu$m in the near infrared (IR) was measured at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station during the Antarctic summers of 1985–1986 and 1990–1991. Similar results were obtained at Vostok Station in summer 1990–1991. The albedo has a uniformly high value of 0.96–0.98 across the UV and visible spectrum, nearly independent of snow grain size and solar zenith angle, and this value probably applies throughout the interior of Antarctica. The albedo in the near IR is lower, dropping below 0.15 in the strong absorption bands at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu$m; and it is quite sensitive to grain size and somewhat sensitive to zenith angle. Near-IR albedos were slightly lower at Vostok than at South Pole, but day-to-day variations in the measured grain size due to precipitation, drifting, and metamorphism were found to cause temporal variations in near-IR albedo larger than those due to any systematic geographical change from South Pole to Vostok. The spectrally averaged albedos ranged from 0.80 to 0.85 for both overcast and clear skies, in agreement with measurements by others at South Pole and elsewhere in Antarctica. Using a two-layer radiative transfer model, the albedo can be explained over the full wavelength range. Tests were made to correct for systematic errors in determining spectral albedo. Under clear skies at about 3000-m elevation the diffuse fraction of downward irradiance varied from 0.4 in the near UV to less than 0.01 in the near IR; knowledge of this fraction is required to correct the measured irradiance for the instrument's deviation from a perfect cosine-response. Furthermore, the deviation from cosine response is itself a function of wavelength. Under clear skies a significant error in apparent albedo can result if the instrument's cosine collector is not parallel to the surface; e.g., if the instrument is leveled parallel to the horizon, but the local snow surface is not horizontal. The soot content of the snow upwind of South Pole Station was only 0.3 ng/g. It was somewhat greater at Vostok Station but was still too small to affect the albedo at any wavelength. Bidirectional reflectance at 0.9-$\mu$m wavelength, measured from a 23-m tower at the end of summer after the sastrugi (snow dunes) had diminished, showed a pattern remarkably similar to the spectrally averaged pattern obtained from the Nimbus 7 satellite.},

abstract = {This study investigates the performance of the isotropic and four anisotropic hourly tilted surface radiation models by using monthly average hourly utilizable energy as a standard of measure. Utilizable energy is the radiation above a specified threshold level. Differences between the utilizable energy measured and the utilizable energy predicted are observed for various surface slope/azimuth orientations and critical radiation levels. Normalized root mean square difference and normalized mean bias difference statistics are formed to quantify the ability of each model to estimate the utilizable energy on a tilted surface. The influence of horizontal diffuse radiation on tilted surface model performance is examined by comparing the predicted utilizable energy on a tilted surface using both measured horizontal diffuse and estimated horizontal diffuse found from diffuse fraction correlations. On an overall basis, the isotropic sky model showed the poorest performance and is not recommended for estimating the hourly radiation on a tilted surface. The anisotropic models have comparable performance to each other. There was no significant degradation of tilted surface model performance when the diffuse radiation is estimated from a diffuse fraction correlation rather than obtained from measurements.},

abstract = {Abstract The role of clouds in modifying the earth's radiation balance is well recognized as a key uncertainty in predicting any potential future climate change. This statement is true whether the climate change of interest is caused by changing emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfates, deforestation, ozone depletion, volcanic eruptions, or changes in the solar constant. This paper presents an overview of the role of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite data in understanding the role of clouds in the global climate system. The paper gives a brief summary of the cloud/radiation problem, and discusses the critical observations needed to support further investigations. The planned EOS data products are summarized, including the critical advances over current satellite cloud and radiation budget data. Key advances include simultaneous observation of radiation budget and cloud properties, additional information an cloud particle size and phase, improved detection of thin clouds and multilayer cloud systems, greatly reduced ambiguity in partially cloud-filled satellite fields of view, improved calibration and stability of satellite-observed radiances, and improved estimates of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, at the surface, and at levels within the atmosphere. Outstanding sampling and remote sensing issues that affect data quality are also discussed. Finally, the EOS data are placed in the context of other satellite observations as well as the critical surface, field experiment, and laboratory data needed to address the role of clouds in the climate system. It is concluded that the EOS data are a necessary but insufficient condition for solution of the scientific cloud/radiation issues. A balanced approach of satellite, field, and laboratory data will be required. These combined data can span the necessary spatial scales of global, regional, cloud cell, and cloud particle physics (i.e., from 108 to 10?7 m).},

Recent work suggests that carbonyl sulfide (COS), a trace gas consumed by plants, could provide a valuable constraint on photosynthesis. Here we analyze airborne observations of COS and carbon dioxide concentrations during the growing season over North America with a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model. We successfully modeled the persistent vertical drawdown of atmospheric COS using the quantitative relation between COS and photosynthesis that has been measured in plant chamber experiments. Furthermore, this drawdown is driven by plant uptake rather than other continental and oceanic fluxes in the model. These results provide quantitative evidence that COS gradients in the continental growing season may have broad use as a measurement-based photosynthesis tracer.},

abstract = {A 5 year record of data from an automatic weather station (AWS) operating in the ablation zone of Storbreen, Norway, has been used to calculate the local surface energy and mass balance. The AWS observations cover five mass-balance years with an unusually strong mass deficit on Storbreen. The average energy flux ( Q ) contributing to melt for the period 2001–06 is 113 W m −2 . Of this, the net shortwave radiation flux is the dominant contributor (92 W m −2 ), followed by the sensible heat flux (20 W m −2 ) and the latent heat flux (9 W m −2 ). The net longwave radiation (–6 W m −2 ) and the subsurface heat flux (–2 W m −2 ) contribute negatively to the budget. Net radiation thus produces 76{\%} of the melt, while the turbulent fluxes and the subsurface heat flux produce 24{\%} of the total melt. The seasonal mean incoming shortwave radiation is remarkably constant between the years, whereas variations in temperature and reflected shortwave radiation (albedo) explain most of the interannual variation in melt. The modelled ablation compares well with the measured ablation from stake readings. The sensitivity of the energy-balance model was examined by varying the surface roughness length of momentum and the sensitivity of the calculated melt by perturbations of temperature, wind speed and relative humidity.},

abstract = {In light of the rapid recent retreat of Arctic sea ice, a number of studies have discussed the possibility of a critical threshold (or "tipping point") beyond which the ice-albedo feedback causes the ice cover to melt away in an irreversible process. The focus has typically been centered on the annual minimum (September) ice cover, which is often seen as particularly susceptible to destabilization by the ice-albedo feedback. Here, we examine the central physical processes associated with the transition from ice-covered to ice-free Arctic Ocean conditions. We show that although the ice-albedo feedback promotes the existence of multiple ice-cover states, the stabilizing thermodynamic effects of sea ice mitigate this when the Arctic Ocean is ice covered during a sufficiently large fraction of the year. These results suggest that critical threshold behavior is unlikely during the approach from current perennial sea-ice conditions to seasonally ice-free conditions. In a further warmed climate, however, we find that a critical threshold associated with the sudden loss of the remaining wintertime-only sea ice cover may be likely.},

According to the leading theory, ice?albedo feedback warms the Arctic Ocean during the summer, and the heat gained by the ocean is released during the winter, causing the cold?season warming. Screen and Simmonds (2010; SS10) concluded that the theory is correct by comparing trend patterns in surface air temperature (SAT), surface turbulence heat flux (HF), and net surface infrared radiation (IR). However, in this comparison, downward IR is more appropriate to use. By analyzing the same data used in SS10 using the surface energy budget, it is shown here that over most of the Arctic the skin temperature trend, which closely resembles the SAT trend, is largely accounted for by the downward IR, not the HF, trend.},

abstract = {The Arctic climate system includes numerous highly interactive small-scale physical processes in the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. During and since the International Polar Year 2007–2009, significant advances have been made in understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice–ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave–turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice–ocean interface, and the mechanical weakening of sea ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes. Uncertainty in the parameterization of small-scale processes continues to be among the greatest challenges facing climate modelling, particularly in high latitudes. Further improvements in parameterization require new year-round field campaigns on the Arctic sea ice, closely combined with satellite remote sensing studies and numerical model experiments.},

abstract = {Associations between cloudiness, radiative fluxes, and surface air temperature in the central Arctic are evaluated from 1) measurements made at Russian drifting ice stations, and 2) atmospheric reanalyses of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In the ice station data, cloudiness is associated with an increase of downward longwave radiation in all months and an increase of net (downward minus upward) total radiation from September through March. The surface air temperatures under overcast skies are 6-deg-9-degC higher than under clear skies during September-March, and the differences are even larger when the observations are stratified by wind as well as cloudiness. The warming by the radiative flux enhancement after a transition from clear skies to overcast has a 1-2-day timescale, while the cooling after the transition to clear skies has a somewhat shorter timescale. The NCEP reanalysis exaggerates slightly the association between cloudiness and surface air temperature, while the ECMWF reanalysis shows a considerably weaker association. The maximum cloud-radiative forcing (MCRF), defined as the difference between the ice station measurements of net surface radiation under cloudy and clear skies, ranges from -59 W m-2 in June to positive values of 20-30 W m-2 in September-March. The annual mean is small but positive, 3 W m-2, despite the approximately three-month summer period of substantially negative MCRF. These findings are consistent with the conventional cloud-radiative forcing obtained in earlier studies using satellite data and one-dimensional models of the Arctic atmosphere and sea ice. Neither reanalysis captures the seasonality of the observationally deduced effects of clouds on surface radiation. The NCEP reanalysis does not capture the seasonality of the actual cloudiness (as defined by the reported cloud fractions), while the ECMWF reanalysis does not show an impact of clouds on the surface solar flux. Issues needing further attention in the model-data comparison are the effects of surface heterogeneities, the characterization of Arctic clouds, the formulational reasons for the discrepancies between the model-derived reanalyses and the observational data, and the implications for model-derived projections of climate change in the Arctic.},

abstract = {We assess the runoff and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet in the Nuuk region (southwest) using output of two regional climate models (RCMs) evaluated by observations. The region encompasses six glaciers that drain into Godthabsfjord. RCM data (1960-2012) are resampled to a high spatial resolution to include the narrow (relative to the native grid spacing) glacier trunks in the ice mask. Comparing RCM gridded results with automatic weather station (AWS) point measurements reveals that locally models can underestimate ablation and overestimate accumulation by up to tens of per cent. However, comparison with lake discharge indicates that modelled regional runoff totals are more accurate. Model results show that melt and runoff in the Nuuk region have doubled over the past two decades. Regional SMB attained negative values in recent high-melt years. Taking into account frontal ablation of the marine-terminating glaciers, the region lost 10-20 km(3) w.e. a(-1) in 2010-12. If 2010 melting prevails during the remainder of this century, a low-end estimate of sea-level rise of 5 mm is expected by 2100 from this relatively small section (2.6{\%}) of the ice sheet alone.},

abstract = {The surface energy balance and meltwater production of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) are modulated by snow and ice albedo through the amount of absorbed solar radiation. Here we show, using spaceborne multispectral data collected during the three decades from 1981 to 2012, that summertime surface albedo over the GrIS decreased at a statistically significant (99 {\%}) rate of 0.02 decade-1 between 1996 and 2012. The negative trend is confined to the regions of the GrIS that undergo melting in summer with the dry-snow zone showing no trend. The period 1981–1996 showed no statistically significant trend. The analysis of the outputs of a regional climate model indicates that the drivers of the observed albedo decrease is imputable to a combination of increased near-surface temperatures, which enhanced melt and promoted growth in snow grain size and the expansion of bare ice areas, as well as by trends in light-absorbing impurities on the snow and ice surfaces. Neither aerosol models nor in situ observations indicate increasing trends in impurities in the atmosphere over Greenland, suggesting that their apparent increase in snow and ice might be related to the exposure of a "dark band" of dirty ice and to the consolidation of impurities at the surface with melt. Albedo projections through the end of the century under different warming scenarios consistently point to continued darkening, with albedo anomalies in 2100 averaged over the whole ice sheet lower than in 2000 by 0.08, driven solely by a warming climate. Future darkening is likely underestimated because of known underestimates in projected melting and because the model albedo scheme does not currently include light-absorbing impurities and the effect of biological activity, which themselves have a positive feedback, leading to increased melting, grain growth and darkening.},

abstract = {While the Arctic region has been warming strongly in recent decades, anomalously large snowfall in recent winters has affected large parts of North America, Europe, and east Asia. Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

abstract = {Annual cycles of downwelling broadband infrared radiative flux and spectral downwelling infrared flux were determined using data collected at the South Pole during 2001. Clear-sky conditions are identified by comparing radiance ratios of observed and simulated spectra. Clear-sky fluxes are in the range of 110-125 W m(-2) during summer (December-January) and 60-80 W m(-2) during winter (April-September). The variability is due to day-to-day variations in temperature, strength of the surface-based temperature inversion, atmospheric humidity, and the presence of "diamond dust" (near-surface ice crystals). The persistent presence of diamond dust under clear skies during the winter is evident in monthly averages of clear-sky radiance. About two-thirds of the clear-sky flux is due to water vapor, and one-third is due to CO2, both in summer and winter. The seasonal constancy of this approximately 2: 1 ratio is investigated through radiative transfer modeling. Precipitable water vapor (PWV) amounts were calculated to investigate the H2O/CO2 flux ratio. Monthly mean PWV during 2001 varied from 1.6 mm during summer to 0.4 mm during winter. Earlier published estimates of PWV at the South Pole are similar for winter, but are 50{\%} lower for summer. Possible reasons for low earlier estimates of summertime PWV are that they are based either on inaccurate hygristor technology or on an invalid assumption that the humidity was limited by saturation with respect to ice. The average fractional cloud cover derived from the spectral infrared data is consistent with visual observations in summer. However, the wintertime average is 0.3-0.5 greater than that obtained from visual observations. The annual mean of longwave downwelling cloud radiative forcing (LDCRF) for 2001 is about 23W m(-2) with no apparent seasonal cycle. This is about half that of the global mean LDCRF; the low value is attributed to the small optical depths and low temperatures of Antarctic clouds.},

Our results suggest that the highest aerosol emissions have been found in south-central China, which has good agreement with the cooling over the region ("cool zone"). Increased summer precipitation in Southern and decreased in Northern China is closed related with the existence of the "cool zone". The cooling effect in "cool zone" in China together with the steady warming over oceans (the South China Sea and the Western North Pacific) resulted in weakened land- sea thermal contrast and thus the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) circulation. The weakened EASM might restrain the rainbelt in southern China longer and less moist penetrated further north in summer season. This could intensify the "north drying with south wetting" summer climate pattern in the eastern China. Trends of Palmer Drought Severity Index indicated a more extensive tendency of dryness considering both precipitation and temperature than precipitation data alone in eastern China.},

abstract = {AbstractThroughout much of the latter half of the twentieth century, the dominant mode of Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical wintertime circulation variability—the Arctic Oscillation (AO)—exhibited a positive trend, with decreasing high-latitude sea level pressure (SLP) and increasing midlatitude SLP. General circulation models (GCMs) show that this trend is related to several factors, including North Atlantic SSTs, greenhouse gas/ozone-induced stratospheric cooling, and warming of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Over the last approximately two decades, however, the AO has been decreasing, with 2009/10 featuring the most negative AO since 1900. Observational and idealized modeling studies suggest that snow cover, particularly over Eurasia, may be important. An observed snow–AO mechanism also exists, involving the vertical propagation of a Rossby wave train into the stratosphere, which induces a negative AO response that couples to the troposphere. Similar to other GCMs, the authors show that transient sim...},

abstract = {We present a method of measuring ice ablation using an absolute pressure transducer as part of an automatic weather station (AWS) system, which we have installed in 17 locations on the Greenland ice sheet. The pressure transducer assembly is drilled into the ice, enclosed in a hose filled with antifreeze liquid. The pressure signal registered by the transducer is that of the vertical column of liquid over the sensor, which can be translated to depth, and ice ablation rate, knowing the density of the liquid. Measuring at sub-daily timescales, this assembly is well suited to monitoring ice ablation in remote regions, with clear advantages over other, well-established methods. The pressure transducer system has the potential to monitor ice ablation for several years without re-drilling, and the system is suitable for high-ablation areas ({\textgreater}5ma -1 ). A routine to transform raw measurements into ablation values is presented, including a physically based method to remove air-pressure variability from the signal. The pressure transducer time series is compared to that recorded by a sonic ranger for the climatically hostile setting on the Greenland ice sheet.},

abstract = {The discovery of the 2012 extreme melt event across almost the entire surface of the Greenland ice sheet is presented. Data from three different satellite sensors - including the Oceansat-2 scatterometer, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder - are combined to obtain composite melt maps, representing the most complete melt conditions detectable across the ice sheet. Satellite observations reveal that melt occurred at or near the surface of the Greenland ice sheet across 98.6{\%} of its entire extent on 12 July 2012, including the usually cold polar areas at high altitudes like Summit in the dry snow facies of the ice sheet. This melt event coincided with an anomalous ridge of warm air that became stagnant over Greenland. As seen in melt occurrences from multiple ice core records at Summit reported in the published literature, such a melt event is rare with the last significant one occurring in 1889 and the next previous one around seven centuries earlier in the Medieval Warm Period. Given its rarity, the 2012 extreme melt across Greenland provides an exceptional opportunity for new studies in broad interdisciplinary geophysical research. Citation: Nghiem, S. V., D. K. Hall, T.

@article{Harrison1990,
abstract = {The NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), flying aboard multiple satellites, is providing new insights into the climate system. Monthly averaged clear-sky and cloudy sky flux data derived from the ERBE are used to assess the impact of clouds on the Earth' s radiation balance. This impact is examined in terms of three quantities: longwave, shortwave, and net cloud forcing. Overall, clouds appear to cool the Earth-atmosphere system. The global mean cooling varied from 14 to 21 W m -2 between April 1985 and January 1986. Hemispherically, the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing nearly cancel each other in the winter hemisphere, while in the summer the negative shortwave cloud forcing is significantly lower than the longwave cloud forcing, producing a strong cooling. Thus clouds significantly reduce the seasonal changes in the net radiative heating of the planet. This reduction is particularly strong over the mid-and high-latitude oceans, where they reduce the summer and spring solar heating by as much as 100-150 W m -2. In the low latitudes, the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing reach peak values over the convectively disturbed regions and tend to offset each other to a large extent. This feature, when combined with the large cooling effect over mid-and high-latitude oceans, leads to the conclusion that clouds significantly reduce the equator-to-pole radiative heating gradient of the planet during spring and summer. In the tropical convective regions the large magnitudes of the shortwave and longwave forcing and the near cancellation of the two suggest that clouds have a significant influence on the vertical distribution of heating between the atmosphere and the surface. Thus the ERBE data reveal that globally, hemispherically, and zonally, clouds have a significant effect on the radiative heating gradients. Comparisons of the ERBE results with general circulation models (GCMs) show that global net cloud forcing can be determined reasonably well from some current versions of the GCMs. Modeled regional and zonal values of radiative cloud forcing, however, indicate a need for considerable improvement.},

abstract = {Empirical relationships between the surface radiative fluxes and satellite-measured radiances derived for the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere, Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radiation sites are applied to compute the shortwave (solar) and longwave (thermal infrared) fluxes over the Pacific warm pool (narrowly defined as the region 10{\o}S-10{\o}N and 135{\o}E-175{\o}E). Even averaged over the entire COARE Intensive Observation Period, November 1992 to February 1993, the net surface radiative heating has a large spatial variation. Regions of minimum shortwave heating, which implies large clouds and strong convection, do not necessarily coincide with regions of maximum sea surface temperature. This indicates that the large-scale atmospheric dynamics, land-sea distribution, and sea surface temperature all play an important role in forcing convection in the warm pool. The total radiative heating (shortwave heating minus longwave cooling) ranges from 125 to 175 W m -2. The large spatial variation of surface radiative heating in the warm pool, averaged over a period of 4 months, could have a significant impact on the sea surface temperature and oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Partitioning of the shortwave heating between the surface and the atmosphere has been estimated. For the entire warm pool during the COARE Intensive Observation Period, the mean insolation at the top of the atmosphere is 420 W m -2, and the planetary albedo is -30{\%}. Two thirds (199 W m -2) of the total heating of the Earth-atmosphere system (294 W m -2) is absorbed at the surface, and one third 2 (95 W m-) is absorbed in the atmosphere. The effect of clouds on the shortwave heating of the atmospheric column is only +9 W m -2, which is not much different from radiation model calculations. The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment fluxes at the top of the atmosphere in the Pacific warm pool for the period November 1986 to February 1987 are used as a proxy for the shortwave heating of the Earth-atmosphere system.},

The IASOA focus is on coordinating intensive measurements of the Arctic atmosphere collected in the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, and Greenland to create synthesis science that leads to an understanding of why and not just how the Arctic atmosphere is evolving. The IASOA premise is that there are limitations with Arctic modeling and satellite observations that can only be addressed with boots-on-the-ground, in situ observations and that the potential of combining individual station and network measurements into an integrated observing system is tremendous. The IASOA vision is that by further integrating with other network observing programs focusing on hydrology, glaciology, oceanography, terrestrial, and biological systems it will be possible to understand the mechanisms of the entire Arctic system, perhaps well enough for humans to mitigate undesirable variations and adapt to inevitable change.},

abstract = {Abstract. To assess the influence of various mechanisms of heat transfer on the near-surface ice of Greenland's ablation zone, we incorporate highly resolved measurements of ice temperature into thermal modeling experiments. Seven separate temperature strings were installed at three different field sites, each with between 17 and 32 sensors and extending up to 20m below the surface. In one string, temperatures were measured every 30 minutes, and the record is continuous for more than three years. We use these measured ice temperatures to constrain modeling analyses focused on four isolated processes to assess the relative importance of each to the near-surface ice temperature: 1) the moving boundary of an ablating surface, 2) thermal insulation by snow, 3) radiative energy input, and 4) temperature gradients below the seasonally active near-surface layer. In addition to these four processes, transient heating events were observed in two of the temperature strings. Despite no observations of meltwater pathways to the subsurface, these heating events are likely the refreezing of liquid water below 5{\&}ndash;10m of cold ice. Together with subsurface refreezing, the five heat transfer mechanisms presented here account for measured differences of up to 3°C between the ice temperature at the depth where annual temperature variability is dissipated and the mean annual air temperature. Thus, in Greenland's ablation zone, the mean annual air temperature cannot be used to predict the near-surface ice temperature, as is commonly assumed.},

Using the best available observations over China, the decadal variability and recent trends in summer rainfall are investigated with the emphasis on changes in the seasonal evolution and on the temporal characteristics of daily rainfall. The possible relationships with global warming are reassessed. Substantial decadal variability in summer rainfall has been confirmed during the period 1958–2008; this is not unique to this period but is also seen in the earlier decades of the twentieth century. Two dominant patterns of decadal variability have been identified that contribute substantially to the recent trend of southern flooding and northern drought. Natural decadal variability appears to dominate in general but in the cases of rainfall intens...},

abstract = {Weekly cycles of the concentration of anthropogenic aerosols have been observed in many regions around the world. The phase and the magnitude of these cycles, however, vary greatly depending on region and season. In the present study the authors investigated important features of the weekly cycles of aerosol concentration and the covariations in meteorological conditions in major urban regions over east China, one of the most polluted areas in the world, in summertime during the period 2001 - 2005/2006. The PM10 (aerosol particulate matters of diameter {\textless} 10 mm) concentrations at 29 monitoring stations show significant weekly cycles with the largest values around midweek and smallest values in weekend. Accompanying the PM10 cycle, the meteorological variables also show notable and consistent weekly cycles. The wind speed in the lower troposphere is relatively small in the early part of the week and increases after about Wednesday. At the same time, the air temperature anomalies in low levels are positive and then become negative in the later part of the week. The authors hypothesize that the changes in the atmospheric circulation may be triggered by the accumulation of PM10 through diabatic heating of lower troposphere. During the early part of a week the anthropogenic aerosols are gradually accumulated in the lower troposphere. Around midweek, the accumulated aerosols could induce radiative heating, likely destabilizing the middle to lower troposphere and generating anomalously vertical air motion and thus resulting in stronger winds. The resulting circulation could promote ventilation to reduce aerosol concentrations in the boundary layer during the later part of the week. Corresponding to this cycle in anthropogenic aerosols the frequency of precipitation, particularly the light rain events, tends to be suppressed around midweek days through indirect aerosol effects. This is consistent with the observed anthropogenic weather cycles, i.e., more ( less) solar radiation near surface, higher (lower) maximum temperature, larger (smaller) diurnal temperature range, and fewer (more) precipitation events in midweek days (weekend).},

abstract = {We present a sensitivity study of the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as modeled using a regional atmospheric climate model, to various parameter settings in the albedo scheme. The snow albedo scheme uses grain size as a prognostic variable and further depends on cloud cover, solar zenith angle and black carbon concentration. For the control experiment the overestimation of absorbed shortwave radiation (+6{\%}) at the K-transect (west Greenland) for the period 2004-2009 is considerably reduced compared to the previous density-dependent albedo scheme (+22{\%}). To simulate realistic snow albedo values, a small concentration of black carbon is needed, which has strongest impact on melt in the accumulation area. A background ice albedo field derived from MODIS imagery improves the agreement between the modeled and observed SMB gradient along the K-transect. The effect of enhanced meltwater retention and refreezing is a decrease of the albedo due to an increase in snow grain size. As a secondary effect of refreezing the snowpack is heated, enhancing melt and further lowering the albedo. Especially in a warmer climate this process is important, since it reduces the refreezing potential of the firn layer that covers the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

abstract = {Multi-decade atmospheric OCS (carbonyl sulfide) infrared measurements have been analyzed with the goal of quantifying long-term changes and evaluating the consistency of the infrared atmospheric OCS remote-sensing measurement record. Solar-viewing grating spectrometer measurements recorded in April 1951 at the Jungfraujoch station (46.5°N latitude, 8.0°E longitude, 3.58 km altitude) show evidence for absorption by lines of the strong $\nu$3 band of OCS at 2062 cm−1. The observation predates the earliest previously reported OCS atmosphere remote-sensing measurement by two decades. More recent infrared ground-based measurements of OCS have been obtained primarily with high-resolution solar-viewing Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs). Long-term trends derived from this record span more than two decades and show OCS columns that have remained constant or have decreased slightly with time since the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, though retrievals assuming different versions of public spectroscopic databases have been impacted by OCS $\nu$3 band line intensity differences of ∼10{\%}. The lower stratospheric OCS trend has been inferred assuming spectroscopic parameters from the high-resolution transmission (HITRAN) 2004 database. Volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles measured near 30°N latitude with high-resolution solar-viewing FTSs operating in the solar occultation mode over a 22 years time span were combined. Atmospheric Trace MOlecucle Spectroscopy (ATMOS) version 3 FTS measurements in 1985 and 1994 were used with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) measurements during 2004–2007. Trends were calculated by referencing the measured OCS VMRs to those of the long-lived constituent N2O to account for variations in the dynamic history of the sampled airmasses. Means and 1-sigma standard deviations of VMRs (in ppbv, or 10−9 per unit air volume) averaged over 30–100 hPa from measurements at 25–35°N latitude are 0.334±0.089 ppbv from 1985 (ATMOS Spacelab 3 measurements), 0.297±0.094 ppbv from 1994 ATLAS 3 measurements, 0.326±0.074 ppbv from ACE 2004 measurements, 0.305±0.096 ppbv from ACE 2005 measurements, 0.328±0.074 from ACE 2006 measurements, and 0.305±0.090 ppbv from ACE measurements through August 2007. Assuming these parameters, we conclude that there has been no statistically significant trend in lower stratospheric OCS over the measurement time span. We discuss past measurement sets, quantify the impact of changes in infrared spectroscopic parameters on atmospheric retrievals and trend measurements, and discuss OCS spectroscopic uncertainties of the current $\nu$3 band parameters in public atmospheric databases.},

abstract = {AbstractThe potential of recent Arctic changes to influence hemispheric weather is a complex and controversial topic with considerable uncertainty, as time series of potential linkages are short ({\textless}10 years) and understanding involves the relative contribution of direct forcing by Arctic changes on a chaotic climatic system. A way forward is through further investigation of atmospheric dynamic mechanisms. During several exceptionally warm Arctic winters since 2007, sea-ice loss in the Barents/Kara Seas initiated eastward-propagating wave trains of high and low pressure. Anomalous high pressure east of the Ural Mountains advected Arctic air over central and eastern Asia, resulting in persistent cold spells. Blocking near Greenland related to low-level temperature anomalies led to northerly flow into eastern North America, inducing persistent cold periods. Potential Arctic connections in Europe are less clear. Variability in the North Pacific can reinforce downstream Arctic changes, and Arctic amplification ...},

abstract = {While the representation of clouds in climate models has become more sophisticated over the last 30+ years, the vertical and seasonal fingerprints of Arctic greenhouse warming have not changed. Are the models right? Observations in recent decades show the same fingerprints: surface amplified warming especially in late fall and winter. Recent observations show no summer cloud response to Arctic sea ice loss but increased cloud cover and a deepening atmospheric boundary layer in fall. Taken together, clouds appear to not affect the fingerprints of Arctic warming. Yet, the magnitude of warming depends strongly on the representation of clouds. Can we check the models? Having observations alone does not enable robust model evaluation and model improvement. Comparing models and observations is hard enough, but to improve models, one must both understand why models and observations differ and fix the parameterizations. It is all a tall order, but recent progress is summarized here.},

abstract = {The present study compared 18 younger (M = 21.00 years) and 17 older adults (M = 64.29 years) in a modified vigilance task that required the inhibition of a routinized response. The task was a 50-min simulation of industrial inspection, wherein observers were presented with simple displays labeled "good" and "bad" parts. General linear modeling indicated that younger adults showed a doubling of inhibition failures over time (from 19{\%} to 43{\%}); older adults' inhibition failures held constant at approximately 17.5{\%}. In both age groups, those who responded most quickly were also most error-prone. A control experiment, using the traditional vigilance task requiring a response to infrequent "bad" parts, found only small age differences in accuracy and these also favored older adults. This research suggests that younger adults may demonstrate larger inhibition failures when the routinized responses on simple tasks must be suppressed. There are several implications for theory, industrial design, and cognitive assessment.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional mesoscale model was applied to simulate wintertime katabatic winds in the Antarctic coastal region. Simulations were made for a constant slope angle with the slope height varying and for fixed slope heights with the slope angle varying. Thermal wind opposed the katabatic flow near the foot of the slope, but enhanced it over the high plateau. The steeper and higher the slope, the stronger the effect on the plateau. The 2 m potential temperature decreased down the slope toward sea ice, because (1) the katabatic wind resulted in the accumulation of cold near-surface air over the sea ice and the lower parts of the slope, (2) over the flat sea ice zone, the stratification was stronger, and (3) the shallow slope was within the strong surface inversion from over the sea ice. With a slope aspect ratio of 5 m km-1 and a slope height below 1000 m, 2 m temperature (T2m) decreased down the slope, but for slope heights of 1500 m and more T2m increased down the slope. Adiabatic warming and, because of the stronger wind, enhanced turbulent mixing of the warmer air from aloft contributed to the warming. For slope angles ranging from 1 to 20 m km-1, with a small slope height of 500 m, T2m decreased down the slope but not monotonically, whereas with a slope height of 2000 m, yielding stronger winds and larger adiabatic warming, T2m increased monotonically down the slope. The model results were supported by observations from several Antarctic sites with different topographic conditions.},

abstract = {Processes in the climate system that can either amplify or dampen the climate response to an external perturbation are referred to as climate feedbacks. Climate sensitivity estimates depend critically on radiative feedbacks associated with water vapor, lapse rate, clouds, snow, and sea ice, and global estimates of these feedbacks differ among general circulation models. By reviewing recent observational, numerical, and theoretical studies, this paper shows that there has been progress since the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in (i) the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in these feedbacks, (ii) the interpretation of intermodel differences in global estimates of these feedbacks, and (iii) the development of methodologies of evaluation of these feedbacks (or of some components) using observations. This suggests that continuing developments in climate feedback research will progressively help make it possible to constrain the GCMs' range of climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity through an ensemble of diagnostics based on physical understanding and observations.},

abstract = {AbstractRadiative fluxes are critical for understanding the energy budget of the Arctic region, where the climate has been changing rapidly and is projected to continue to change. This work investigates causes of present-day biases and future projections of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Arctic radiative fluxes in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled (CERES-EBAF), CMIP5 net TOA downward shortwave (SW) flux biases are larger than outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) biases. The primary contributions to modeled TOA SW flux biases are biases in cloud amount and snow cover extent compared to the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) and the newly developed Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) dataset, respectively (with most models predicting insufficient cloud amount and snow cover in the Arctic), and biases with sea ice albedo.

@article{Mortin2016,
abstract = {The timing of melt onset affects the surface energy uptake throughout the melt season. Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset.},

The weekend effect is defined as the average value (e.g., the diurnal temperature range) for Saturday through Monday minus the average value for Wednesday through Friday. A composite of the ground observations over northeastern China presents that, during 26-year (1980{\&}ndash;2005) summers, the weekend effect in the diurnal temperature range increased by 1.2{\&}{\#}176;C. Conversely, the weekend effects in the relative humidity, cloud amount, and light rain ({\&}le;5 mm day {\&}minus;1) events decreased. These changes are due to a shifted phase of the weekly cycle of the meteorological variables. The long-term change in weekend effects have a high correlation coefficient ({\&}mid; r {\&}mid; {\&}ap; 0.8) with the decrease in relative humidity over the region, which is likely induced by regional warming. The results suggest that regional warming is a possible factor in a transition of dominant aerosol effects in the weekend effect.},

The daytime method uses the 0.65-, 3.8-, 10.8-, and 12.0-mum channels on the TRMM Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Terra and Aqua MODIS. The VIRS and Terra 1.6-mum channel and the Aqua 1.38- and 2.1-mum channels are used secondarily. The primary nighttime radiances are from the 3.8-, 10.8-, and 12.0- mum channels. Significant differences were found between the VIRS and Terra 1.6-mum and the Terra and Aqua 3.8-mum channels' calibrations. Cascading threshold tests provide clear or cloudy classifications that are qualified according to confidence levels or other conditions, such as sunglint, that affect the classification. The initial infrared threshold test classifies {\~{}}43{\%} of the pixels as clouds. The next level seeks consistency in three (two) different channels during daytime (nighttime) and accounts for roughly 40{\%} (25{\%}) of the pixels. The third tier uses refined thresholds to classify remaining pixels. For cloudy pixels, {\~{}} 4{\%} yield no retrieval when analyzed with a cloud retrieval algorithm. The techniques were applied to data between 1998 and 2006 to yield average nonpolar cloud amounts of {\~{}} 0.60.

abstract = {Upwelling and downwelling, shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes are calculated at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface using a complete radiative transfer model and observations of the physical properties of the surface, atmosphere, and clouds based on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data sets. Results are obtained every three hours over the whole globe for every third month from April 1985 to January 1989. Sensitivity studies are conducted to assess the uncertainties in calculated fluxes caused by the estimated uncertainties in the measurement or specification of the input quantities. Except in the polar regions, uncertainties in cloud properties are no longer the predominant source of radiative flux uncertainty, even at the surface; rather they produce uncertainties similar in magnitude to those caused by atmospheric and surface properties. The largest uncertainty in upwelling shortwave (SW) fluxes (approximate to 10 - 15 W/m(2), regional daily mean) is caused by uncertainties in land surface albedo, whereas the largest uncertainty in downwelling SW at the surface (approximate to 5 - 10 W/m(2), regional daily mean) is related to cloud detection errors. The uncertainty of upwelling longwave (LW) fluxes (approximate to 10 - 20 W/m(2), regional daily mean) depends on the accuracy of the surface temperature for the surface LW fluxes and the atmospheric temperature for the top of atmosphere LW fluxes. The dominant source of uncertainty in downwelling LW fluxes at the surface (approximate to 10 - 15 W/m(2)) is uncertainty in atmospheric temperature and, secondarily, atmospheric humidity; clouds play little role except in the polar regions. The uncertainties of the individual flux components and the total net fluxes are largest over land (15 - 20 W/m(2)) because of uncertainties in surface albedo (especially its spectral dependence) and surface temperature and emissivity (including its spectral dependence). Clouds are the most important modulator of the SW fluxes, but over land areas, uncertainties in net SW at the surface depend almost as much on uncertainties in surface albedo. Although atmospheric and surface temperature variations cause larger LW flux variations, the most notable feature of the net LW fluxes is the changing relative importance of clouds and water vapor with latitude. Uncertainty in individual flux values is dominated by sampling effects because of large natural variations, but uncertainty in monthly mean fluxes is dominated by bias errors in the input quantities.},

Although absorbed shortwave$\backslash$nradiation is the most important energy source for melt at all three$\backslash$nsites, interannual melt variability at the lowest site is driven$\backslash$nmainly by variability in the turbulent flux of sensible heat.

abstract = {The Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radiation measurements in the western Pacific warm pool are used to estimate surface solar radiation budgets and to validate radiation model calculations. Clear-sky fluxes are identified from the measurements of direct and diffuse fluxes at the ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurements) site of Kavieng by simultaneously imposing conditions that 1) the direct downward solar flux is a maximum, 2) the diffuse downward solar flux is a minimum, and 3) the total flux varies smoothly with time. Averaged over the four TOGA COARE months, the clear-sky downward solar flux at Kavieng is 308 W m-2, with a range of 302-317 W m-2. The estimated clear-sky solar flux, together with the temperature and humidity radiosondings, are then used to validate radiation model calculations. Using an inferred aerosol optical thickness of 0.12, results show that clear-sky surface solar fluxes can be reliably computed from a radiation model. The effect of clouds on surface solar radiation is found to be large. Averaged over the four TOGA COARE months and the seven radiation stations, the surface cloud radiative forcing is 99 W m-2 with a range of 79-112 W m-2. This result of the mean cloud radiative forcing is in agreement with other current studies.},

Available : Gregory Retrieved : 22 Abstract We take advantage of climate simulations from two multimodel experiments to characterize and evaluate the cloud phase partitioning in 16 general circulation models (GCMs) , specifically the vertical structure of the transition between liquid and ice in clouds . We base our analysis on the ratio of ice condensates to the total condensates (phase ratio , PR) . Its transition at 90{\%} (PR90) and its links with other relevant variables are evaluated using the GCM - Oriented Cloud - Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation Cloud Product climatology , reanalysis data , and other satellite observations . In 13 of 16 models , the PR90 transition height occurs too low (6 km to 8 . 4 km) and at temperatures too warm ({\`{A}}13 . 9°C to {\`{A}}32 . 5°C) compared to observations (8 . 6 km , {\`{A}}33 . 7°C) ; features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with respect to ice above 6 . 5 km . However , this bias would be slightly reduced by using the lidar simulator . In convective regimes (more humid air and precipitation) , the observed cloud phase transition occurs at a warmer temperature than for subsidence regimes (less humid air and precipitation) . Only few models manage to roughly replicate the observed correlations with humidity (5 / 16) , vertical velocity (5 / 16) , and precipitation (4 / 16) ; 3 / 16 perform well for all these parameters (MPI - ESM , NCAR - CAM5 , and NCHU) . Using an observation - based Clausius - Clapeyron phase diagram , we illustrate that the Bergeron - Findeisen process is a necessary condition for models to represent the observed features . Finally , the best models are those that include more complex microphysics .},

abstract = {The transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to midlatitude dynamics. We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60°N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)—anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68{\%} of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60°N in winter and 56{\%} in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams—AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60°N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.},

abstract = {Abstract. We use the CloudSat data record 2006{\&}ndash;2016 to estimate snowfall over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). We first evaluate CloudSat snowfall retrievals with respect to remaining ground-clutter issues. Comparing CloudSat observations to the GrIS topography (obtained from airborne altimetry measurements during IceBridge) we find that at the edges of the GrIS spurious high snowfall retrievals caused by ground clutter occasionally affect the operational snowfall product. After correcting for this effect, the height of the lowest valid CloudSat observation is about 1200 meters above the local topography as defined by IceBridge. We then use ground-based Millimeter Wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR) observations obtained from the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit, Greenland (ICECAPS) experiment to devise a simple, empirical correction to account for precipitation processes occurring between the height of the observed CloudSat reflectivities and the snowfall near the surface. Using the height-corrected, clutter-cleared CloudSat reflectivities we next evaluate various Z-S relationships in terms of snowfall accumulation at Summit through comparison with weekly stake field observations of snow accumulation available since 2007. Using a set of three Z-S relationships that best agree with the observed accumulation at Summit, we then calculate the annual cycle snowfall over the entire GrIS as well as over different drainage areas and compare the so-derived mean values and annual cycles of snowfall to ERA-Interim reanalysis. We find the annual mean snowfall over the GrIS inferred from CloudSat to be 34{\&}thinsp;{\&}pm;{\&}thinsp;7.5{\&}thinsp;cm/yr liquid equivalent (where the uncertainty is determined by the range in values between the three different Z-S relationships used). In comparison, the ERA-Interim reanalysis product only yields 30{\&}thinsp;cm/yr liquid equivalent snowfall, where the majority of the underestimation in the reanalysis appears to occur in the summer months over the higher GrIS and appears to be related to shallow precipitation events. Comparing all available estimates of snowfall accumulation at Summit Station, we find the annually averaged liquid equivalent snowfall from the stake field to be between 20 and 24{\&}thinsp;cm/yr, depending on the assumed snowpack density, and from CloudSat 23{\&}thinsp;{\&}pm;{\&}thinsp;4.5{\&}thinsp;cm/yr. The annual cycle at Summit is generally similar between all data sources, with the exception of ERA-Interim reanalysis, which shows the aforementioned under-estimation during summer months.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a simple yet general approach to estimate the uncertainties that arise in satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth when the retrievals use one-dimensional radiative transfer theory for heterogeneous clouds that have variations in all three dimensions. For the first time, preliminary error bounds are set to estimate the uncertainty of cloud optical depth retrievals. These estimates can help us better understand the nature of uncertainties that three-dimensional effects can introduce into retrievals of this important product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument. The probability distribution of resulting retrieval errors is examined through theoretical simulations of shortwave cloud reflection for a set of cloud fields that represent the variability of stratocumulus clouds. The results are used to illustrate how retrieval uncertainties change with observable and known parameters, such as solar elevation or cloud brightness. Furthermore, the results indicate that a tendency observed in an earlier study?clouds appearing thicker for oblique sun?is indeed caused by three-dimensional radiative effects.},

abstract = {Annual total precipitation and the annual accumulation on the Greenland ice sheet are evaluated and presented in two maps. The maps are based on accumulation measurements of 251 pits and cores obtained from the upper accumulation zone and precipitation measurements made at 35 meteorological stations in the coastal region. To construct the accumulation map, the annual precipitation was split into solid and liquid precipitation components. Annual total precipitation exceeding 2500 mm w.e. occurs on the southeastern tip of Greenland, while the minimum precipitation is estimated to occur on the northeastern slope of the ice sheet. The mean annual precipitation for all of Greenland is 340 mm w.e. The largest annual accumulation of about 1500 mm w.e. is found on the glaciers in the southeastern corner of Greenland, while the smallest accumulation is found on the northeastern slope of the ice sheet west of Danmarkshavn. The mean accumulation on the Greenland ice sheet is estimated at 310 mm w.e. The regional difference in accumulation is examined with respect to the 850 hPa (mbar) level circulation. The present surface topography is found to play an important role in determining regional accumulation on the ice sheet.},

abstract = {Greenland ice sheet surface temperatures are controlled by an exchange of energy at the surface, which includes radiative, turbulent and ground heat fluxes. Data collected by multiple projects are leveraged to calculate estimates of all surface energy budget (SEB) terms at Summit, Greenland for the full annual cycle from July 2013{\&}ndash;June 2014 and extend to longer periods for the radiative and turbulent SEB terms. Radiative fluxes are measured directly by a suite of broadband radiometers. Turbulent sensible heat flux is primarily estimated via the bulk aerodynamic method, and the turbulent latent heat flux is calculated via a two level approach using measurements at 10 and 2{\&}thinsp;m. The subsurface heat flux is calculated using a string of thermistors buried in the snow pack. Extensive quality-control data processing produced a data set in which all terms of the SEB are present 75{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the full annual cycle, despite the harsh conditions. By including a storage term for a near surface layer, the SEB is balanced in this data set to within the aggregated uncertainties for the individual terms. November and August case studies illustrate that surface radiative forcing is driven by synoptically forced cloud characteristics, especially by low-level, liquid-bearing clouds. The annual cycle and seasonal diurnal cycles of all SEB components indicate that the non-radiative terms are anti-correlated to changes in the total radiative flux, and are hence responding to cloud radiative forcing. Generally, the non-radiative SEB terms and the upwelling longwave radiation component compensate for changes in downwelling radiation, although exact partitioning of energy in the response terms varies with season and near-surface characteristics such as stability and moisture availability. Substantial surface warming from low-level clouds typically leads to a change from a very stable to a weakly stable near-surface regime with no solar radiation or from a weakly stable to neutral/unstable regime with solar radiation. Relationships between forcing terms and responding surface fluxes show that the upwelling longwave radiation produces 55{\&}ndash;75{\&}thinsp;{\%} (40{\&}ndash;50{\&}thinsp;{\%}) of the total response in the winter (summer) and the non-radiative terms compensate for the remaining change in the combined downwelling longwave and net shortwave radiation. Because melt conditions are rarely reached at Summit, these relationships are documented for conditions of surface-temperature below 0{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C, with and without solar radiation. This is the first time that forcing and response term relationships have been investigated in detail for the Greenland SEB. These results should both advance understanding of process relationships over the Greenland icecap and be useful for model validation.},

Annual snow cover extent over the last 19 years decreased up to 6×105 km2 relative to a 0.93°C (0.33°C) increase in North American (Northern Hemisphere) temperature. A strong correlation exists between snow cover and temperature where up to 78{\%} of the variance in regional snow cover and snowfall is explained by the anomalies of monthly mean maximum temperature. Over the last two decades the decrease in snow cover during winter (December-March) has largely occurred through reduced frequency of snow cover in areas that typically have a high probability of snow on the ground with little change in the frequency of snow cover in other areas. Similar characteristics were observed during spring (April-May) in areas with high snow cover probability except for an expansion of the snow-free regions. Anomalies in these two seasons dominate the interannual variab...},

abstract = {Observed and projected climate warming is strongest in the Arctic regions, peaking in autumn/ winter. Attempts to explain this feature have focused primarily on identifying the associated climate feedbacks, particularly the ice-albedo and lapse-rate feedbacks. Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model in idealized seasonal forcing simulations to show that Arctic warming (especially in winter) and sea ice decline are particularly sensitive to radiative forcing in spring, during which the energy is effectively ‘absorbed' by the ocean (through sea ice melt and ocean warming, amplified by the ice-albedo feedback) and consequently released to the lower atmosphere in autumn and winter, mainly along the sea ice periphery. In contrast, winter radiative forcing causes a more uniform response centered over the Arctic Ocean. This finding suggests that intermodel differences in simulated Arctic (winter) warming can to a considerable degree be attributed to model uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes, which peak in summer},

I estimated the magnitude of the cloud feedback in response to short-term climate variations by analyzing the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget from March 2000 to February 2010. Over this period, the short-term cloud feedback had a magnitude of 0.54 ± 0.74 (2$\sigma$) watts per square meter per kelvin, meaning that it is likely positive. A small negative feedback is possible, but one large enough to cancel the climate's positive feedbacks is not supported by these observations. Both long- and short-wave components of short-term cloud feedback are also likely positive. Calculations of short-term cloud feedback in climate models yield a similar feedback.

abstract = {The directional emissivity of snow and ice surfaces in the 8–14 $\mu$m thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window was determined from spectral radiances obtained by field measurements using a portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in conjunction with snow pit work. The dependence of the directional emissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths $\lambda$=10.5–12.5 $\mu$m which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 $\mu$m and 12.5 $\mu$m for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity at $\lambda$=12.5 $\mu$m for the off-nadir angle of 75° reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window.},

abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA) is a reanalysis designed to produce an improved representation of the Earth's hydrologic cycle. In this paper we examine the representation of deep convective clouds in MERRA, comparing analyzed liquid and ice clouds with deep convective cloud objects observed by instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. We find that MERRA contains deep convective cloud in 98.1{\%} of the observed cases. MERRA-derived probability density functions (PDFs) of cloud properties have similar form as the observed PDFs and exhibit a similar trend with changes in object size. Total water path, optical depth, and outgoing shortwave radiation in MERRA are found to match the cloud object observations quite well, however there appears to be a bias toward higher than observed cloud tops in the MERRA. The reanalysis fits the observations most closely for the largest class of convective systems, with performance generally decreasing with a transition to smaller convective systems. Comparisons of simulated total water path, optical depth, and outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) are found to be highly sensitive to the assumed subgrid distribution of condensate and indicate the need for caution when interpreting model-data comparisons that require disaggregation of grid-scale cloud to satellite pixel scales.},

abstract = {In this study the effects of changes in the physics package of the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2 on the modelled surface energy balance, near-surface temperature and wind speed of Antarctica are presented. The physics package update primarily consists of an improved turbulent and radiative flux scheme and a revised cloud scheme that includes a parameterisation for ice cloud super-saturation. The ice cloud super-saturation has led to more moisture being transported onto the continent, resulting in more and optically thicker clouds and more downward long-wave radiation. Overall, the updated model better represents the surface energy balance, based on a comparison with {\textgreater} 750 months of data from nine automatic weather stations located in East Antarctica. Especially the representation of the turbulent sensible heat flux and net long-wave radiative flux has improved with a decrease in biases of up to 40{\%}. As a result, modelled surface temperatures have increased and the bias, when compared to 10m snow temperatures from 64 ice-core observations, has decreased from -2.3K to -1.3 K. The weaker surface temperature inversion consequently improves the representation of the sensible heat flux, whereas wind speed biases remain unchanged. However, significant model biases remain, partly because RACMO2 at a resolution of 27 km is unable to resolve steep topography.},

In contrast, exchange of CH3SH and CS2 were sporatic and inconsistent. Although some interspecific variation occurred for the first three gases, exchange rates were relatively uniform and were not influenced by irradiance conditions. In contrast to DMS and H2S emission, COS uptake was strongly influenced by degree of thallus hydration.

If cloud detection errors and differences in area sampling are neglected, individual ISCCP cloud amounts agree with individual surface observations to within 15{\%} rms with biases of only a few percent. When measurements of small-scale, broken clouds are isolated in the comparison, the rms differences between satellite and surface cloud amounts are about 25{\%}, similar to the rms difference between ISCCP and Landsat determinations of cloud amount.

abstract = {AbstractNew objectively balanced observation-based reconstructions of global and continental energy budgets and their seasonal variability are presented that span the golden decade of Earth-observing satellites at the start of the twenty-first century. In the absence of balance constraints, various combinations of modern flux datasets reveal that current estimates of net radiation into Earth's surface exceed corresponding turbulent heat fluxes by 13–24 W m−2. The largest imbalances occur over oceanic regions where the component algorithms operate independent of closure constraints. Recent uncertainty assessments suggest that these imbalances fall within anticipated error bounds for each dataset, but the systematic nature of required adjustments across different regions confirm the existence of biases in the component fluxes. To reintroduce energy and water cycle closure information lost in the development of independent flux datasets, a variational method is introduced that explicitly accounts for the rel...},

abstract = {The paper tries to reconcile the facts that there are often useful correlations between ablation or run-off and air temperature while net radiation is usually the major source of ablation energy. Equations are derived from the energy balance to describe statistics for the ablation-temperature relation in terms of statistics for the relations between individual energy fluxes and air temperature. As examples, statistics are evaluated for four published series from Arctic Canada. Although the net radiation is the largest energy source in all four cases, the ablation rate is moderately well correlated with temperature and poorly correlated with net radiation. This is because the sensible heat flux is more variable than the radiation in three cases and is itself better correlated with temperature in all four cases. The major contributions to the increase of ablation rate with temperature (on average 6.3 kg m −2 d −1 deg −1 ) are due to sensible heat, followed by latent heat with a small contribution from net radiation. The resulting ablation-temperature model explains about half the variance of ablation rate. The main application of such a simple model is for the estimation of ablation totals in areas where glaciological and hydrological data are sparse. On tente de concilier le fait qu' il y a souvent une corr{\'{e}}lation utilisable entre l'ablation ou l'{\'{e}}coulement et la temp{\'{e}}rature de l'air, avec celui que le bilan radiatif net est d'ordinaire la principale source d'{\'{e}}nergie disponible pour l'ablation. On a tir{\'{e}} du bilan {\'{e}}nerg{\'{e}}tique des {\'{e}}quations pour d{\'{e}}crire statistiquement la relation ablation-temp{\'{e}}rature {\`{a}} partir des relations statistiques entre les flux individuels d'{\'{e}}nergie et la temp{\'{e}}rature de l'air. Par exemple, on analyse statistiquement quatre s{\'{e}}ries de donn{\'{e}}es publi{\'{e}}es concernant l'Arctique Canadien. Bien que le bilan radiatif net soit dans les quatre cas la source principale d'{\'{e}}nergie, la vitesse de l'ablation est relativement bien corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}e avec la temp{\'{e}}rature mais mal avec la radiation nette. Ceci tient {\`{a}} ce que le flux de chaleur sensible est plus variable que la radiation dans trois cas et est lui-m{\^{e}}me mieux corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}} avec la temp{\'{e}}rature dans les quatre cas. Les principales contributions {\`{a}} l'augmentation de la vitesse d'ablation avec la temp{\'{e}}rature (d' environ 6,3 kg m −2 d −1 deg −1 ) sont dues {\`{a}} la chaleur sensible, suivie par la chaleur latente avec une petite contribution de la radiation nette. Le mod{\`{e}}le r{\'{e}}sultant ablation-temp{\'{e}}rature explique {\`{a}} peu pr{\'{e}}s la moiti{\'{e}} de la variance de la vitesse d'ablation. La principale application d'un mod{\`{e}}le aussi simple est l'estimation des totaux d‘ablation dans les r{\'{e}}gions o{\`{u}} les donn{\'{e}}es glaciologiques et hydrologiques sont rares. Die Arbeit versucht die Tatsachen, dass h{\"{a}}ufig n{\"{u}}tzliche Korrelationen zwischen Ablation oder Abfluss und Lufttemperatur herangezogen werden, w{\"{a}}hrend die Netto-Strahlung gew{\"{o}}hnlich die Hauptquelle der Ablationsenergie bildet, in {\"{U}}bereinstimmung zu bringen. Aus der Energiebilanz werden Gleichungen zur Beschreibung des statistischen Verhaltens der Beziehung zwischen Ablation und Temperatur aus der Statistik f{\"{u}}r die Beziehung zwischen den einzelnen Energiefl{\"{u}}ssen und der Lufttemperatur hergeleitet. Als Beispiele werden die Statistik f{\"{u}}r 4 ver{\"{o}}ffentlichte Beobachtungszeiten aus der Kanadischen Arktis bearbeiet. Obwohl die Netto-Strahlung in allen 4 F{\"{a}}llen die gr{\"{o}}sste Energiequelle darstellt, ist die Ablationsrate mit der Temperatur recht gut korreliert, mit der Netto-Ablation dagegen nur schwach. Der Grund daf{\"{u}}r liegt darin, dass der Fluss der f{\"{u}}hlbaren W{\"{a}}rme in 3 F{\"{a}}llen st{\"{a}}rker schwankt als die Strahlung und mit der Temperatur in allen 4 F{\"{a}}llen besser korreliert ist. Den gr{\"{o}}ssten Beitrag zum Anwachsen der Ablation mit der Temperatur (im Mittel 6,3 kg m −2 d −1 deg −1 ) liefert die f{\"{u}}hlbare W{\"{a}}rme, gefolgt von der latenten W{\"{a}}rme mit einem kleinen Anteil aus der Netto-Strahlung.

After correcting for the impact of changing snowpack properties associated with unprecedented surface melting in 2012, we find good agreement (3 cm/yr bias) with airborne measurements. With the aid of regional climate and firn modeling, we compute high spatial and temporal resolution records of Greenland mass evolution, which correlate (R=0.96) with monthly satellite gravimetry and reveal glacier dynamic imbalance. During 2011–2014, Greenland mass loss averaged 269±51 Gt/yr. Atmospherically driven losses were widespread, with surface melt variability driving large fluctuations in the annualmass deficit. Terminus regions of five dynamically thinning glaciers, which constitute less than 1{\%} of Greenland's area, contributed more than 12{\%} of the net ice loss. This high-resolution record demonstrates thatmass deficits extending over small spatial and temporal scales have made a relatively large contribution to recent ice sheet imbalance.},

abstract = {Pulses of warm and moist air from lower latitudes provide energy to the Arctic and form its main energy source outside of the summer months. These pulses can cause substantial surface warming and trigger ice melt. Air-mass transport in the opposite direction, away from the Arctic, leads to cold-air outbreaks. The outbreaks are often associated with cold extremes over continents, and extreme surface heat fluxes and occasional polar lows over oceans. Air masses advected across the strong Arctic-to-mid-latitude temperature gradient are rapidly transformed into colder and dryer or warmer and moister air masses by clouds, radiative and turbulent processes, particularly in the boundary layer. Phase changes from liquid to ice within boundary-layer clouds are critical in these air-mass transformations. The presence of liquid water determines the radiative effects of these clouds, whereas the presence of ice is crucial for subsequent cloud decay or dissipation, processes that are poorly represented in weather and climate models. We argue that a better understanding of how air masses are transformed on their way into and out of the Arctic is essential for improved prediction of weather and climate in the Arctic and mid-latitudes. Observational and modelling exercises should take an air-mass-following Lagrangian approach to attain these goals.},

abstract = {Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest single contributor to eustatic sea level and is amplified by the growth of pigmented algae on the ice surface, which increases solar radiation absorption. This biological albedo-reducing effect and its impact upon sea level rise has not previously been quantified. Here, we combine field spectroscopy with a radiative-transfer model, supervised classification of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite remote-sensing data, and runoff modelling to calculate biologically driven ice surface ablation. We demonstrate that algal growth led to an additional 4.4-6.0 Gt of runoff from bare ice in the south-western sector of the GrIS in summer 2017, representing 10{\%}-13{\%} of the total. In localized patches with high biomass accumulation, algae accelerated melting by up to 26.15±3.77{\%} (standard error, SE). The year 2017 was a high-albedo year, so we also extended our analysis to the particularly low-albedo 2016 melt season. The runoff from the south-western bare-ice zone attributed to algae was much higher in 2016 at 8.8-12.2 Gt, although the proportion of the total runoff contributed by algae was similar at 9 {\%}-13 {\%}. Across a 10 000 km2 area around our field site, algae covered similar proportions of the exposed bare ice zone in both years (57.99{\%} in 2016 and 58.89{\%} in 2017), but more of the algal ice was classed as "high biomass" in 2016 (8.35 {\%}) than 2017 (2.54 {\%}). This interannual comparison demonstrates a positive feedback where more widespread, higher-biomass algal blooms are expected to form in highmelt years where the winter snowpack retreats further and earlier, providing a larger area for bloom development and also enhancing the provision of nutrients and liquid water liberated from melting ice. Our analysis confirms the importance of this biological albedo feedback and that its omission from predictive models leads to the systematic underestimation of Greenland's future sea level contribution, especially because both the bare-ice zones available for algal colonization and the length of the biological growth season are set to expand in the future.},

abstract = {We describe in situ measurements of the compaction of Antarctic snow. At three different sites in Antarctica, the rate of compaction was measured hourly, over various depth intervals, for up to two years. These measurements show that compaction at each of the sites occurs through slow, viscous deformation of the snowpack, with no significant contribution from sudden collapse of weak layers. The measured rates of compaction at the coldest site exhibit a strong seasonality, consistent with a temperature-dependent sintering mechanism having activation energy of 70 kJ mol{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. At the two warmer sites, activation energies of 80 and 120 kJ mol{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} provide slightly better agreement with the observations. Published models of snow compaction underestimate the temperature sensitivity. A good match to our observations is provided by a semi-empirical model, based on rate equations for lattice-diffusion (Nabarro-Herring) creep of material around pores, combined with normal grain growth. This model also provides a theoretical basis for a widely used empirical model of snow compaction. The rate coefficient for lattice-diffusion inferred from our measurements is considerably higher than published values, however, and other creep mechanisms cannot be ruled out.

@article{Refsgaard2007,
abstract = {A terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modelling process, its interaction with the broader water management process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modelling processes. Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment and characterisation: data uncertainty engine (DUE), error propagation equations, expert elicitation, extended peer review, inverse modelling (parameter estimation), inverse modelling (predictive uncertainty), Monte Carlo analysis, multiple model simulation, NUSAP, quality assurance, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, stakeholder involvement and uncertainty matrix. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modelling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed. It is concluded that uncertainty assessment is not just something to be added after the completion of the modelling work. Instead uncertainty should be seen as a red thread throughout the modelling study starting from the very beginning, where the identification and characterisation of all uncertainty sources should be performed jointly by the modeller, the water manager and the stakeholders. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Arctic System Reanalysis version 1 (ASRv1), a high-resolution regional assimilation of model output, observations, and satellite data across the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and the global European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting Interim Reanalysis (ERAI) are compared to atmospheric observations for the period December 2006 – November 2007. Results throughout the troposphere show observations to be well assimilated in ASRv1, as monthly and annual near-surface (upper-level) temperature, dew point (relative humidity), pressure (geopotential height), and wind speed biases compared to surface stations and radiosondes are very small. These results are similar to ERAI, though wind speed biases are significantly smaller in ASRv1. Despite ASRv1's use of a 3D-variational (Var) assimilation compared to ERAI's 4D-Var, similar results suggest that a regional approach with higher-resolution terrain and a detailed land surface description forced by a global reanalysis may improve the assimilation of observations and help offset temporal information lost by 3D-Var compared to 4D-Var. However, ASRv1 forecast field results compared to ERAI are mixed. ASRv1 and ERAI show negative precipitation biases during cool months compared to gauge observations, and too much precipitation falls in ASRv1 during summer in the mid-latitudes. Stations north of 60°N demonstrate smaller precipitation biases in ASRv1 than ERAI except during the summer when ASRv1 is very dry. Shortwave radiation compared to observations is much too large in ASR, and both reanalyses show longwave radiation deficits during most months. These results point to inadequacies in model physics in ASRv1 (e.g. convective and radiation schemes) that will continue to be refined in subsequent versions of ASR.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The high...},

abstract = {Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a new grain fumigant which has been developed to replace methyl bromide, being phased out due to its ozone depletion properties, and to supplement phosphine gas which is experiencing increased insect resistance. Treatment of commodities with COS, a highly effective fumigant, results in residues that are near or indistinguishable to natural background levels of this compound. COS is a naturally occurring gas, being the predominant sulfur moiety in the atmosphere, occurs naturally in food and is a normal by-product of mammalian aerobic metabolism. COS has low acute inhalational toxicity but with a steep dose response curve; COS is neither genotoxic nor a developmental toxicant but does reversibly impair male fertility. Prolonged, repeated exposure to COS is likely to present similar neurotoxicity hazards to that of the structurally and toxicologically related compound carbon disulfide. Although the occupational risks presented by COS as a fumigant of bulk grain are significant, these are, as they have been for a considerable time for phosphine and methyl bromide, manageable by good occupational safety practices. Consideration may need to be given to scrubbing of ventilated COS and its breakdown product hydrogen sulfide, at the completion of fumigation to minimise worker and bystander exposure. In terms of classical regulatory toxicology studies, the available database for COS is deficient in many aspects and registration in most jurisdictions will depend on sound scientific argument built upon the totality of the existing scientific data as there are strong arguments supporting the registration of this compound.},

The negative phase of the NAO enhances summertime warming and insolation while reducing snowfall, especially in west Greenland, driving surface mass balance (SMB) more negative, as illustrated using the regional climate model MAR. The spatial pattern of accelerating mass changes reflects the geography of NAO-driven shifts in atmospheric forcing and the ice sheet's sensitivity to that forcing. We infer that southwest Greenland will become a major future contributor to sea level rise.},

abstract = {A climatology of particle scattering properties in the wintertime High Arctic troposphere, including vertical distributions and effective radii, is presented. The measurements were obtained using a lidar and cloud radar located at Eureka, Nunavut Territory (80 degrees N, 86 degrees W). Four different particle groupings are considered: boundary-layer ice crystals, ice clouds, mixed-phase clouds, and aerosols. Two-dimensional histograms of occurrence probabilities against depolarization, radar/lidar colour ratio and height are given. Colour ratios are related to particle minimum dimensions (i.e., widths rather than lengths) using a Mie scattering model. Ice cloud crystals have effective radii spanning 25-220 mu m, with larger particles observed at lower altitudes. Topographic blowing snow residuals in the boundary layer have the smallest crystals at 15-70 mu m. Mixed-phase clouds have water droplets and ice crystal precipitation in the 5-40 mu m and 40-220 mu m ranges, respectively. Ice cloud crystals have depolarization decreasing with height. The depolarization trend is associated with the large ice crystal sub-population. Small crystals depolarize more than large ones in ice clouds at a given altitude, and show constant modal depolarization with height. Ice clouds in the mid-troposphere are sometimes observed to precipitate to the ground. Water clouds are constrained to the lower troposphere (0.5-3.5 km altitude). Aerosols are most abundant near the ground and are frequently mixed with the other particle types. The data are used to construct a classification chart for particle scattering in wintertime Arctic conditions.},

The authors estimate the systematic errors in the measurements of downward longwave radiation caused by solar heating of the pyrgeometer's dome. Pyrgeometer measurements have been obtained in a series of experiments in which the dome of the pyrgeometer has been, alternately, exposed to the solar beam and shaded by a disk. These measurements have been completed with solar direct irradiance and wind velocity measurements. This study confirms previous assessments about the magnitude of this effect and its possible estimation in terms of global horizontal solar irradiance. Additionally, the authors have quantified the influence of natural ventilation on the solar heating effect. The experiments have confirmed the reduction of the solar heating effect with a...},

abstract = {Eddy covariance technique to measure CO2, wa- ter and energy fluxes between biosphere and atmosphere is widely spread and used in various regional networks. Cur- rently more than 250 eddy covariance sites are active around the world measuring carbon exchange at high temporal res- olution for different biomes and climatic conditions. In this paper a new standardized set of corrections is introduced and the uncertainties associated with these corrections are as- sessed for eight different forest sites in Europe with a total of 12 yearly datasets. The uncertainties introduced on the two components GPP (Gross Primary Production) and TER (Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration) are also discussed and a quantitative analysis presented. Through a factorial analy- sis we find that generally, uncertainties by different correc- tions are additive without interactions and that the heuristic u∗-correction introduces the largest uncertainty. The results show that a standardized data processing is needed for an ef- fective comparison across biomes and for underpinning inter- annual variability. The methodology presented in this paper has also been integrated in the European database of the eddy covariance measurements. Correspondence},

abstract = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Arctic summer sea ice has diminished fast in recent decades. A strong year-to-year variability on top of this trend indicates that sea ice is sensitive to short-term climate fluctuations. Previous studies show that anomalous atmospheric conditions over the Arctic during spring and summer affect ice melt and the September sea ice extent (SIE). These conditions are characterized by clouds, humidity, and heat anomalies that all affect downwelling shortwave (SWD) and longwave (LWD) radiation to the surface. In general, positive LWD anomalies are associated with cloudy and humid conditions, whereas positive anomalies of SWD appear under clear-sky conditions. Here the effect of realistic anomalies of LWD and SWD on summer sea ice is investigated by performing experiments with the Community Earth System Model. The SWD and LWD anomalies are studied separately and in combination for different seasons. It is found that positive LWD anomalies in spring and early summer have significant impact on the Sept...},

The rate of warming at Summit is increasing over time. During the instrumental period (1987–2011), warming has been greatest in the winter season, although the implications of summer warming are more acute. The annual maximum elevation of the equilibrium line and dry snow line has risen at 44 and 35 m/a over the past 15 and 18 years, respectively. Extrapolation of this observed trend now suggests, with 95{\%} confidence intervals, that the dry snow facies of the Greenland Ice Sheet will inevitably transition to percolation facies.

The posterior distributions derived from the statistical assumptions incorporate the criteria of bias and convergence in the relative weights implicitly assigned to the ensemble members. This approach can be considered an extension and elaboration of the reliability ensemble averaging method. For illustration, the authors consider the output of mean surface temperature from nine AOGCMs, run under the A2 emission scenario from the Synthesis Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), for boreal winter and summer, aggregated over 22 land regions and into two 30-yr averages representative of current and future climate conditions.

Downward longwave radiation is an essential element for sea ice reduction, but can only be sustained by excessive upward heat flux from the sea surface exposed to air in the region of sea ice loss. The increased turbulent heat flux is used to increase air temperature and specific humidity in the lower troposphere, which in turn increases downward longwave radiation. This feedback process is clearly observed in the Barents and Kara Seas in the reanalysis data. A quantitative assessment reveals that this feedback process is amplifying at the rate of {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;8.9{\&}thinsp;{\%} every year during 1979{\&}ndash;2016. Based on this estimate, sea ice will completely disappear in the Barents and Kara Seas by around 2025. Availability of excessive heat flux is necessary for the maintenance of this feedback process; a similar mechanism of sea ice loss is expected to take place over the sea-ice covered polar region when sea ice is not fully recovered in winter.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier (the 79 fjord, henceforth referred to as 79N) has been thinning and accelerating since the early 2000s, as a result of calving episodes at the front of the glacier. As 8{\%} of the Greenland ice sheet area drains into 79N, changes in the stability of 79N could propagate into the interior of Greenland. Despite this concern, relatively little is known about the atmospheric conditions over 79N. We present the surface atmospheric processes and climatology of the 79N region from analyses of data from four Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and reanalysis data from ERA-Interim. Over the floating section of the glacier, the annual average air temperature is -16.7°C, decreasing to -28.5°C during winter. Winds over the glacier are predominantly westerly and are of katabatic origin. Over the last 39 years the near-surface air temperature has increased at a rate of +0.08°C year−1. In addition, we find that large, rapid (48-hour) temperature increases ({\textgreater} 10°C) occur during the fiv...},

abstract = {The stable isotope ratios of atmospheric CO(2) ((18)O/(16)O and (13)C/(12)C) have been monitored since 1977 to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere-atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way. Interpreting the (18)O/(16)O variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO(2) are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Previous attention focused on the decreasing (18)O/(16)O ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration; a global increase in C(4) crops at the expense of C(3) forests; and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence and solar radiation, that affect CO(2) exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years' worth of data on (18)O/(16)O in CO(2) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Ni{\~{n}}o increases the (18)O/(16)O ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO(2) by biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Ni{\~{n}}o anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Ni{\~{n}}o events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO(2) with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year, may be too low, and that a best guess of 150-175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO(2). Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models.},

abstract = {Observed meteorological data and a high-resolution (5 km) model were used to simulate Greenland ice sheet surface melt extent and trends before the satellite era (1960–79) and during the satellite era through 2010°. The model output was compared with passive microwave satellite observations of melt extent. For 1960–2010 the average simulated melt extent was 15 ± 5{\%}. For the period 1960–72, simulated melt extent decreased by an average of 6{\%}, whereas 1973–2010 had an average increase of 13{\%}, with record melt extent in 2010. The trend in simulated melt extent since 1972 indicated that the melt extent in 2010 averaged twice that in the early 1970s. The maximum and mean melt extents for 2010 were 52{\%} (∼9.5 × 10 5 km 2 ) and 28{\%} (∼5.2 × 10 5 km 2 ), respectively, due to higher-than-average winter and summer temperatures and lower-than-average winter precipitation. For 2010, the southwest Greenland melt duration was 41–60 days longer than the 1960–2010 average, while the northeast Greenland melt duration was up to 20 days shorter. From 1960 to 1972 the melting period (with a {\textgreater}10{\%} melt extent) decreased by an average of 3 days a− 1 . After 1972, the period increased by an average of 2 days a− 1 , indicating an extended melting period for the ice sheet of about 70 days: 40 and 30 days in spring and autumn, respectively.},

To interpret this record, results from the SSM/I are examined in conjunction with fields from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and output from a regional climate model. The record surface melt reflects unusually warm conditions, seen in positive summertime anomalies of surface air temperatures, downwelling long-wave radiation, 1000-500 hPa atmospheric thickness, and the net surface energy flux, linked in turn to southerly airflow over the ice sheet. Low snow accumulation may have contributed to the record through promoting anomalously low surface albedo.},

Data from 16 AWS locations, spanning the years 2000–2003, were used for this assessment. In situ reflected shortwave data were corrected for a systematic positive spectral sensitivity bias of between 0.01 and 0.09 on a site-by-site basis using precise optical black radiometer data. Results indicate that the MOD43 albedo product retrieves snow albedo with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of ±0.07 as compared to the station measurements, which have ±0.035 RMSE uncertainty. If we eliminate all satellite retrievals that rely on the backup algorithm and consider only the highest quality results from the primary bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) algorithm, the MODIS albedo RMSE is ±0.04, slightly larger than the in situ measurement uncertainty. There is general agreement between MODIS and in situ observations for albedo {\textless}0.7, while near the upper limit, a −0.05 MODIS albedo bias is evident from the scatter of the 16-site composite.},

abstract = {The authors summarize the twenty-first-century Arctic climate simulated by NCAR's Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). Under a strong radiative forcing scenario, the model simulates a much warmer, wetter, cloudier, and stormier Arctic climate with considerably less sea ice and a fresher Arctic Ocean. The high correlation among the variables composing these changes-temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, sea level pressure (SLP), and ice concentration-suggests that their close coupling collectively represents a fingerprint of Arctic climate change. Although the projected changes in CCSM4 are generally consistent with those in other GCMs, several noteworthy features are identified. Despite more global warming in CCSM4, Arctic changes are generally less than under comparable greenhouse forcing in CCSM3, as represented by Arctic amplification (16{\%} weaker) and the date of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean (20 years later). Autumn is the season of the most pronounced Arctic climate change among all the primary variables. The changes are very similar across the five ensemble members, although SLP displays the largest internal variability. The SLP response exhibits a significant trend toward stronger extreme Arctic cyclones, implying greater wave activity that would promote coastal erosion. Based on a commonly used definition of the Arctic (the area encompassing the 10 degrees C July air temperature isotherm), the region shrinks by about 40{\%} during the twenty-first century, in conjunction with a nearly 10-K warming trend poleward of 70 degrees N. Despite this pronounced long-term warming, CCSM4 simulates a hiatus in the secular Arctic climate trends during a decade-long stretch in the 2040s and to a lesser extent in the 2090s. These pauses occur despite averaging over five ensemble members and are remarkable because they happen under the most extreme greenhouse-forcing scenario and in the most climatically sensitive region of the world.},

abstract = {Clouds play a pivotal role in the surface energy budget of the Polar regions. Here we use two largely independent datasets of cloud and surface downwelling radiation observations derived by satellite remote sensing (2007-2010) to evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over both Polar ice sheets and oceans in state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalyses (ERA-Interim and MERRA-2) and the CMIP5 climate model ensemble. Firstly, we show that, compared to CERES-EBAF, CloudSat-CALIPSO better represents cloud liquid and ice water path over high latitudes, owing to its recent explicit determination of cloud phase that will be part of its new R05 release. The reanalyses and climate models disagree widely on the amount of cloud liquid and ice in the Polar regions. Compared to the observations, we find significant but inconsistent biases in the model simulations of cloud liquid and ice water, as well as in the downwelling radiation components. The CMIP5 models display a wide range of cloud characteristics of the Polar regions, especially with regard to cloud liquid water, limiting the representativeness of the multi-model mean. A few CMIP5 models (CNRM, GISS, GFDL, and IPSL{\_}CM5b) clearly outperform the others, which enhances credibility in their projected future cloud and radiation changes over high latitudes. Given the rapid changes in Polar regions and global feedbacks involved, future climate model developments should target improved representation of Polar clouds. To that end, remote sensing observations are crucial, in spite of large remaining observational uncertainties, which is evidenced by the substantial differences between the two datasets.},

In this article the operational Cloudsat hydrometeor detection algorithm is described, difficulties due to surface clutter are discussed, and several examples from the early mission are shown.

Previous research has shown large uncertainties in simulating future changes in this critical system. The simulated THC response to idealized freshwater perturbations and the associated climate changes have been intercompared as an activity of World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project/Paleo-Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP/PMIP) committees. This intercomparison among models ranging from the earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) to the fully coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) seeks to document and improve understanding of the causes of the wide variations in the modeled THC response. The robustness of particular simulation features has been evaluated across the model results.

Until now, global climate models have not been considered suitable to model ice sheet SMB owing to model biases and insufficient resolution. This study analyzes the GIS SMB simulated for the period 1850–2005 by the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which includes a new ice sheet component with multiple elevation classes for SMB calculations. The model is evaluated against observational data and output from the regional model Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2 (RACMO2). Because of a lack of major climate biases, a sophisticated calculation of snow processes (including surface albedo evolution) and an adequate downscaling technique, CESM is able to realistically simulate GIS surface climate and SMB. CESM SMB agrees reasonably well with in situ data from 475 locations (r = 0.80) and output from RACMO2...},

model simulation: a simple model given a $\backslash$delta surface tmp equation
LWP vs 2m tmp vs surface tmp vs melting

1) model validation:
a) tmp 2m {\~{}}= tmp surface
b) tmp vs clouds: observation
2) LWP threshold case study
3) MODIS: this kind of LWP does exist
4) discuss on lat vs alt

2, they do exist

1, why the melting is sig recently; any changes of this kind of clouds recently?
2, what will happen to this kind of clouds? any feedbacks?
3, correspondings check
4, what determines the clouds temperature

Seasonality is evident in aerosol optical thickness measurements, with a minimum in January and a maximum in April to July. The diurnal variations of aerosols, however, are detectable but largely affected by local and regional weather conditions, such as surface and upper-level winds. On calm clear days, aerosols peak during the two rush hours in the morning and evening. Furthermore, the anthropogenic-induced weekly cycles of aerosols and clouds are analyzed, which by themselves are weak, as the anthropogenic signal is mixed with noise of natural weather variability. In addition, corresponding cloud properties observed from MODIS demonstrate an opposite phase to the seasonality of aerosols. Nevertheless, no clear relationship was observed between monthly mean aerosols and rainfall measurements from NASA{\&}{\#}039;s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), implying that in the summer the aerosol impact may not be the primary reason for the change of urban rainfall amount.},

abstract = {The FLOHOF field campaign took place in the period July 21 to August 24, 2007 on and in the surroundings of Hofsj{\"{o}}kull glacier in Central Iceland. During the campaign, 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) recording temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, pressure, and precipitation were deployed on and around the glacier. In addition, atmospheric soundings were performed N and S of Hofsj{\"{o}}kull by a tethered balloon, pilot balloons, and two unmanned aerial systems (UAS). An energy balance station, consisting of a net radiometer and an eddy correlation flux measurement station, has also been installed. This paper describes the experimental setup of the campaign and presents first results of the data analysis with respect to transience of mountain-induced gravity waves, the extension of katabatic winds into the surrounding of the glacier, the occurrence of katabatic microfronts, and report on novel approaches to probe the vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer by UAS. The observed pressure perturbations related to transient gravity wave activity due to changing inflow conditions were between -2 and 2 hPa in general, with positive values upstream and negative values downstream. Differential heating of the glacier and its surrounding is triggering daytime katabatic flow from the glacier into its surrounding. During the campaign, those katabatic winds typically reached out 4-7 km from the edge of the glacier. During late night in clear sky conditions, frontal-like microstructures have been observed frequently with typical repetition times in the order of 30-60 min indicating the interaction of large-scale synoptic and nighttime katabatic density flows close to the ground. The first research application of the newly developed small unmanned meteorological observer proved the applicability of the system for atmospheric boundary layer research by successfully profiling the atmosphere up to 3.5 km above ground. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The new double-moment microphysics scheme described in Part I of this paper is implemented into a single-column model to simulate clouds and radiation observed during the period 1 April–15 May 1998 of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) and First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment–Arctic Clouds Experiment (FIRE–ACE) field projects. Mean predicted cloud boundaries and total cloud fraction compare reasonably well with observations. Cloud phase partitioning, which is crucial in determining the surface radiative fluxes, is fairly similar to ground-based retrievals. However, the fraction of time that liquid is present in the column is somewhat underpredicted, leading to small biases in the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes at the surface. Results using the new scheme are compared to parallel simulations using other microphysics parameterizations of varying complexity. The predicted liquid water path and cloud phase is significantly improved using the new scheme relative to a single-moment parameterization predicting only the mixing ratio of the water species. Results indicate that a realistic treatment of cloud ice number concentration (prognosing rather than diagnosing) is needed to simulate arctic clouds. Sensitivity tests are also performed by varying the aerosol size, solubility, and number concentration to explore potential cloud–aerosol–radiation interactions in arctic stratus.},

A 2000-year transient climate simulation with the Community Climate System Model shows the same temperature sensitivity to changes in insolation as does our proxy reconstruction, supporting the inference that this long-term trend was caused by the steady orbitally driven reduction in summer insolation. The cooling trend was reversed during the 20th century, with four of the five warmest decades of our 2000-year-long reconstruction occurring between 1950 and 2000.},

Compared to GEOPROF-LIDAR, low-level ({\textless} 1 km) cloud occurrences in CCCM are larger over tropical oceans because the CCCM algorithm uses a more relaxed threshold of Cloud-Aerosol Discrimination (CAD) score for CALIPSO vertical feature mask (VFM) product. In contrast, mid-level (1–8 km) cloud occurrences in GEOPROF-LIDAR are larger than CCCM at high latitudes ({\textgreater} 40°). The difference occurs when hydrometeors are detected by CALIPSO lidar but are undetected by CloudSat radar. In the comparison of cloud radiative effects (CREs), global mean differences between CCCM and FLXHR-LIDAR are mostly smaller than 5 W m-2, while noticeable regional differences are found. For example, CCCM shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) CREs are larger than FXLHR-LIDAR along the west coasts of Africa and America because the GEOPROF-LIDAR algorithm misses shallow marine boundary layer clouds. In addition, FLXHR-LIDAR SW CREs are larger than CCCM counterpart over tropical oceans away from the west coasts of America. Over midlatitude storm-track regions, CCCM SW and LW CREs are larger than FLXHR-LIDAR counterpart.},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Project was designed to improve our understanding of the relationship between clouds and solar and longwave radiation. This is achieved using satellite broad-band instruments to map the top-of-atmosphere radiation fields with coincident data from satellite narrow-band imagers employed to retrieve the properties of clouds associated with those fields. This paper documents the CERES Edition-2 cloud property retrieval system used to analyze data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Visible and Infrared Scanner and by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites covering the period 1998 through 2007. Two daytime retrieval methods are explained: the Visible Infrared Shortwave-infrared Split-window Technique for snow-free surfaces and the Shortwave-infrared Infrared Near-infrared Technique for snow or ice-covered surfaces. The Shortwave-infrared Infrared Split-window Technique is used for all surfaces at night. These methods, along with the ancillary data and empirical parameterizations of cloud thickness, are used to derive cloud boundaries, phase, optical depth, effective particle size, and condensed/frozen water path at both pixel and CERES footprint levels. Additional information is presented, detailing the potential effects of satellite calibration differences, highlighting methods to compensate for spectral differences and correct for atmospheric absorption and emissivity, and discussing known errors in the code. Because a consistent set of algorithms, auxiliary input, and calibrations across platforms are used, instrument and algorithm-induced changes in the data record are minimized. This facilitates the use of the CERES data products for studying climate-scale trends.},

We demonstrate very strong recent warming along the west coast of Greenland, especially during winter (locally {\textgreater}10 °C since 1991), and rather weaker warming on the east Greenland coast, which is influenced by different oceanographic/sea-ice and meteorological synoptic forcing conditions to the rest of Greenland. Coastal Greenland seasonal mean SAT trends were generally 2–6 °C, strongest in winter (5.7 °C) and least in summer and autumn (both 2.2 °C), during 1981–2011/12. Since 2001 Greenland mean coastal SAT increased significantly by 2.9 °C in winter and 0.8 °C in summer but decreased insignificantly by 1.1 °C in autumn and 0.2 °C in spring, during a period when there was little net change (≤ ± 0.1 °C) in northern hemisphere temperatures. SAT means for the latest 2001–11/12 decade were significantly in excess of those for peak decadal periods during the Early Twentieth Century Warm Period only in summer and winter, and not significantly greater in spring and autumn. Summer SAT increases in southern Greenland for the last 20 years were generally greater for maximum than minimum temperatures. By contrast, in winter, the recent warming was greater for minimum than maximum temperatures. The greatest SAT changes in all seasons are seen on Greenland's west coast. SAT changes on the ice sheet and a key marginal glacier closely followed nearby coastal temperatures over the last 20 years.},

abstract = {During the EGAMES (Evasion of GAses from the MEditerranean Sea) expedition in the Aegean and eastern Ionian Sea in July 1993, we measured atmospheric and sea surface concentrations of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The surface waters were found to be supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere at all times with an average saturation ratio of 2.6 in open ocean areas and 5.2 in coastal areas. Using air-sea exchange coefficients based on the empirical model by Liss and Merlivat (1986), we estimated an average COS flux of 55 nmol m−2 day−1 from the ocean into the atmosphere. Although the supersaturation of COS was twice as high in coastal areas, during our cruise the flux was not different from open ocean areas because of extremely low windspeeds encountered at coastal areas. We observed a clear diel cycle for coastal area averages and open ocean averages of COS. This cycle could be described using an empirical model including terms for photoproduction, dark production, hydrolysis and air-sea exchange. The in situ COS photoproduction rates were found to be 0.12 fmol l−1 s−1 W−1 m2 for coastal areas and 0.03 fmol 1−1 s−1 W−1 m2 for open ocean areas. After correction to surface light intensities, the coastal and open ocean photoproduction rates were 0.99 and 0.08 fmol l−1 s−1 W−1 m2. Our model provides a satisfactory fit to the open ocean field measurements only if a dark production term is included. The dark production rates were 0.38 and 0.55 fmol l−1 s−1, for coastal and open ocean areas, respectively. From incubation experiments with open ocean waters carried out on board the R.V. Aegaio we found average photoproduction rates of 0.09 fmol l−1 s−1 W−1 m2 and dark production rates of 0.42 fmol 1−1 s−1, which are very close to the values found in sea surface open ocean waters. Finally, we observed photo decomposition of methyl mercaptane (MeSH) at a rate between 0.41 and 1.7 fmol l−1 s−1 W−1 m2 suggesting MeSH as a potential precursor of COS.},

Parallel experiments with different ocean model configurations (full-depth, slab, and no interactive ocean) allow the roles of dynamical and thermodynamic ocean feedbacks to be isolated. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 30°N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the intertropical convergence zones shift equatorward. Ocean dynamics are fundamental to producing this equatorially symmetric pattern...},

Emphasis is placed on assessing total error over the solar shortwave spectrum from 250 to 4500 nm, as well as supporting investigation over other relevant shortwave spectral ranges. The total measurement error introduced by sensor tilt is dominated by the direct component. For a typical high latitude albedo measurement with a solar zenith angle of 60°, a sensor tilted by 1, 3, and 5° can respectively introduce up to 2.6, 7.7, and 12.8 {\%} error into the measured irradiance and similar errors in the derived albedo. Depending on the daily range of solar azimuth and zenith angles, significant measurement error can persist also in integrated daily irradiance and albedo.},

abstract = {The surface temperature response to greenhouse gas forcing displays a characteristic pattern of polar-amplified warming1–5, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The causes of this polar amplification (PA) are still debated. While some studies highlight the importance of the surface-albedo feedback6–8, others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks9, specifically the local lapse-rate and Planck feedbacks4,10. Additionally, changes in atmo- spheric and oceanic heat transport are thought to play a role11–16. Here we perform climate model simulations with CO2 forcing prescribed in distinct geographical regions to determine the causes of PA. The sum of climate responses to regional forcings approximates well the re- sponse to global forcing, thus permitting an attribution of polar warming to local and remote processes. PA is found to be dominated by forcing in polar regions. While extra-polar forcing contributes to polar warming, it induces a largely uniform warming pattern due to enhanced poleward heat transport, thus contributing little to PA. The relative contributions of different processes to polar warming strongly depends on where CO2 forcing is applied. However, PA is primarily caused by direct CO2 forcing at the poles and positive local lapse-rate feedback, with ice-albedo and Planck feedbacks contributing to a lesser degree.},

abstract = {Socio-economically motivated land use changes are a major threat for species diversity of grasslands throughout the world. Here, we comprehensively explore how plant species diversity of grasslands in the species-rich cultural landscape of the Swiss Alps depends on recent land use changes, and, neglected in previous studies, on old cultural traditions. We studied diversity in 216 grassland parcels at three altitudinal levels in 12 villages of three cultural traditions (Romanic, Germanic, and Walser). In valleys of Romanic villages more different parcel types tended to occur than in those of Germanic and Walser villages, suggesting that socio-economic differences among cultural traditions still play a role in shaping landscape diversity. Moreover, at the village level, higher man-made landscape diversity was associated with higher plant species richness. All observed changes in land use reduced the farmers' workload. Plant species richness was lower in fertilized than in unfertilized parcels and in abandoned compared with used parcels. Grazing slightly reduced species richness compared with mowing among unfertilized parcels, while in fertilized parcels it had a positive influence. The highest species diversity was found in mown unfertilized subalpine grasslands. Nevertheless, moderate grazing of former meadows can be a valuable alternative to abandonment. We conclude that the ongoing changes in land use reduce plant species richness within parcels and at the landscape level. To preserve plant species diversity at the landscape level a high diversity of land use types has to be maintained.},

abstract = {The NASA announcement of record surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet in July 2012 led us to examine the atmospheric and oceanic climatic anomalies that are likely to have contributed to these exceptional conditions and also to ask the question of how unusual these anomalies were compared to available records. Our analysis allows us to assess the relative contributions of these two key influences to both the extreme melt event and ongoing climate change. In 2012, as in recent warm summers since 2007, a blocking high pressure feature, associated with negative NAO conditions, was present in the mid-troposphere over Greenland for much of the summer. This circulation pattern advected relatively warm southerly winds over the western flank of the ice sheet, forming a ‘heat dome' over Greenland that led to the widespread surface melting. Both sea-surface temperature and sea-ice cover anomalies seem to have played a minimal role in this record melt, relative to atmospheric circulation. Two representative coastal climatological station averages and several individual stations in south, west and north-west Greenland set new surface air temperature records for May, June, July and the whole (JJA) summer. The unusually warm summer 2012 conditions extended to the top of the ice sheet at Summit, where our reanalysed (1994–2012) DMI Summit weather station summer (JJA) temperature series set new record high mean and extreme temperatures in 2012; 3-hourly instantaneous 2-m temperatures reached an exceptional value of 2.2°C at Summit on 11 July 2012. These conditions translated into the record observed ice-sheet wide melt during summer 2012. However, 2012 seems not to be climatically representative of future ‘average' summers projected this century.},

abstract = {Airborne particles of mineral dust play a key role in Earth's climate system and affect human activities around the globe. The numerical weather modeling community has undertaken considerable efforts to accurately forecast these dust emissions. Here, for the first time in the literature, we thoroughly describe and document the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) dust emission scheme for the Georgia Institute of Technology-Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) aerosol model within the Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) and compare it to the other dust emission schemes available in WRF-Chem. The AFWA dust emission scheme addresses some shortcomings experienced by the earlier GOCART-WRF scheme. Improved model physics are designed to better handle emission of fine dust particles by representing saltation bombardment. WRF-Chem model performance with the AFWA scheme is evaluated against observations of dust emission in southwest Asia and compared to emissions predicted by the other schemes built into the WRF-Chem GOCART model. Results highlight the relative strengths of the available schemes, indicate the reasons for disagreement, and demonstrate the need for improved soil source data.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We evaluate Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface reflectance and albedo trends using the newly released Collection 6 (C6) MODIS products over the period 2001{\&}ndash;2016. We find that the correction of MODIS sensor degradation provided in the new C6 data products reduces the magnitude of the surface reflectance and albedo decline trends obtained from previous MODIS data (i.e. Collection 5, C5). Collection 5 and 6 data product analysis over GrIS is characterized by surface (i.e. wet vs. dry) and elevation (i.e. 500{\&}thinsp;m{\&}ndash;2000{\&}thinsp;m, 2000{\&}thinsp;m and greater) conditions over the summer season from June 1{\&}ndash;August 31. Notably, the visible-wavelength declining reflectance trends identified in several bands MODIS C5 data from previous studies are only slightly detected, at reduced magnitude in the C6 versions over the dry snow zone. Wet snow albedo decline over the MODIS record remains in the C6 product, albeit at a lower magnitude than obtained using C5 data. Further analysis of C6 spectral reflectance trends show both reflectance increases and decreases in select bands and regions, suggesting that several competing processes are contributing to ice sheet albedo change. Investigators using MODIS data in other fields may consider similar re-examinations of trends previously established using C5 data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While all of these forcing products are reanalyses assumed to represent the same climate, they produce significant differences in the MAR simulated SMB over their common period. A temperature adjustment of +1{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C (respectively {\&}minus;1{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C) improved the accuracy of MAR boundary conditions from both ERA-20C and 20CRv2 reanalyses given that ERA-20C (resp. 20CRv2) is 1{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C colder (resp. warmer) over Greenland than ERA-Interim over 1980{\&}ndash;2010. Comparisons with daily PROMICE near-surface observations validated these adjustments. Comparisons with SMB measurements from PROMICE, ice cores and satellite derived melt extent reveal the most accurate forcing data sets for simulating the GrIS SMB to be ERA-Interim and NCEP-NCARv1. However, some biases remain in MAR suggesting that some improvements need still to be done in its cloudiness and radiative scheme as well as in the representation of the bare ice albedo. Results from all forcing simulations indicate: (i) the period 1961{\&}ndash;1990 commonly chosen as a stable reference period for Greenland SMB and ice dynamics is actually a period when the SMB was anomalously positive ({\~{}}{\&}thinsp;+10{\&}thinsp;{\%}) compared to the last 120 years; (ii) SMB has decreased significantly after this reference period due to increasing and unprecedented melt reaching the highest rates in the 120 year common period; (iii) before 1960, both ERA-20C and 20CRv2 forced MAR simulations suggest a significant precipitation increase over 1900{\&}ndash;1950 although this increase could be the result of an artefact in reanalysis not enough constrained by observations during this period. These MAR-based SMB and accumulation reconstructions are however quite similar to those from Box (2013) after 1930, which confirms the Box (2013)'s stationarity assumption of SMB over the last century. Finally, the ERA-20C forced simulation only suggests that SMB during the 1920{\&}ndash;1930 warm period over Greenland was comparable to the SMB of the 2000's due to both higher melt and lower precipitation than normal.},

abstract = {Abstract Characterizing the performance of ground-based commercial radiometers in cold and/or low-pressure environments is critical for developing accurate flux measurements in the polar regions and in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Commercially available broadband radiometers have a stated operational temperature range of, typically, −20° to +50°C. Within this range, their temperature dependencies of sensitivities change less than 1{\%}. But for deployments on high-altitude platforms or in polar regions, which can be much colder than −20°C, information on temperature dependency of sensitivity is not always available. In this paper, the temperature dependencies of sensitivities of popular pyranometers and pyrgeometers manufactured by Kipp and Zonen were tested in a thermal-vacuum chamber. When their body temperature is lowered to −60°C, pyranometer sensitivity drops by 4{\%}–6{\%} from the factory-default specification. Pyrgeometer sensitivity increases by 13{\%} from the factory-default specification during...},

abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass in an accelerated fashion, which is for {\~{}}60{\%} dominated by an increase in surface melting. Clouds exhibit an important control on the GrIS surface energy balance and surface melt. Therefore, to better simulate present and future GrIS climate, it is essential to represent clouds correctly in climate models. Here we use ground (at Summit Station) and satellite remote sensing (from CloudSat‐CALIPSO) observations to evaluate GrIS cloud characteristics in several versions of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) over the period 2007–2012. Cloud cover, phase, water path, and radiative effects over the GrIS vary widely across the atmosphere models. Thanks to the inclusion of new cloud physical parameterizations, that is, ice nucleation and prognostic precipitation, in the most recent CAM version (CAM6), this model, amongst the various CAM versions, is best able to represent GrIS clouds, summer temperatures, and surface melting. However, CAM6 shows excessive rainfall over the ice sheet, which is an important outstanding model bias. Our study demonstrates the importance of simulating realistic cloud properties to improve climate model simulations of GrIS climate and climate change.},

abstract = {The authors investigate the atmospheric response to projected Arctic sea ice loss at the end of the twenty- first century using an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a land surface model. The response was obtained from two 60-yr integrations: one with a repeating seasonal cycle of specified sea ice conditions for the late twentieth century (1980–99) and one with that of sea ice conditions for the late twenty- first century (2080–99). In both integrations, a repeating seasonal cycle of SSTs for 1980–99 was prescribed to isolate the impact of projected future sea ice loss. Note that greenhouse gas concentrations remained fixed at 1980–99 levels in both sets of experiments. The twentieth- and twenty-first-century sea ice (and SST) con- ditions were obtained from ensemble mean integrations of a coupled GCM under historical forcing and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario forcing, respectively. The loss of Arctic sea ice is greatest in summer and fall, yet the response of the net surface energy budget over the Arctic Ocean is largest in winter. Air temperature and precipitation responses also maximize in winter, both over the Arctic Ocean and over the adjacent high-latitude continents. Snow depths increase over Siberia and northern Canada because of the enhanced winter precipitation. Atmospheric warming over the high-latitude continents is mainly confined to the boundary layer (below ;850 hPa) and to regions with a strong low-level temperature inversion. Enhanced warm air advection by submonthly transient motions is the primary mechanism for the terrestrial warming. A significant large-scale atmospheric circulation re- sponse is found during winter, with a baroclinic (equivalent barotropic) vertical structure over the Arctic in November–December (January–March). This response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in February only. Comparison with the fully coupled model reveals that Arctic sea ice loss ac- counts for most of the seasonal, spatial, and vertical structure of the high-latitude warming response to greenhouse gas forcing at the end of the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {Precious little is known about the composition of low-level clouds over the Antarctic Plateau and their effect on climate. In situ measurements at the South Pole using a unique tethered balloon system and ground-based lidar reveal a much higher than anticipated incidence of low-level, mixed-phase clouds (i.e., consisting of supercooled liquid water drops and ice crystals). The high incidence of mixed-phase clouds is currently poorly represented in global climate models (GCMs). As a result, the effects that mixed-phase clouds have on climate predictions are highly uncertain. We modify the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) GCM to align with the new observations and evaluate the radiative effects on a continental scale. The net cloud radiative effects (CREs) over Antarctica are increased by +7.4 Wm(-2), and although this is a significant change, a much larger effect occurs when the modified model physics are extended beyond the Antarctic continent. The simulations show significant net CRE over the Southern Ocean storm tracks, where recent measurements also indicate substantial regions of supercooled liquid. These sensitivity tests confirm that Southern Ocean CREs are strongly sensitive to mixed-phase clouds colder than -20 °C.},

abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interaction is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic radiative forcing of Earth's climate, and aerosol-induced cloud water changes are particularly poorly constrained in climate models. By combining satellite retrievals of volcano and ship tracks in stratocumulus clouds, we compile a unique observational data set and confirm that liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosols are bidirectional, and on average the increases in LWP are closely compensated by the decreases. Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45{\%}.},

abstract = {Regional climate model runs using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesocale Model modified for use in polar regions (Polar MM5), calibrated by independent in situ observations, demonstrate coherent regional patterns of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (SMB) change over a 17-yr period characterized by warming (1988–2004). Both accumulation and melt rates increased, partly counteracting each other for an overall negligible SMB trend. However, a 30{\%} increase in meltwater runoff over this period suggests that the overall ice sheet mass balance has been increasingly negative, given observed meltwater-induced flow acceleration. SMB temporal variability of the whole ice sheet is best represented by ablation zone variability, suggesting that increased melting dominates over increased accumulation in a warming scenario. The melt season grew in duration over nearly the entire ablation zone by up to 40 days, 10 days on average. Accumulation area ratio decreased by 3{\%}. Albedo reductions are apparent in five years of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived data (2000–04). The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived albedo changes (1988–99) were less consistent spatially. A conservative assumption as to glacier discharge and basal melting suggests an ice sheet mass loss over this period greater than 100 km yr-1, framing the Greenland ice sheet as the largest single glacial contributor to recent global sea level rise. Surface mass balance uncertainty, quantified from residual random error between model and independent observations, suggests two things: 1) changes smaller than approximately 200 km yr-1 would not satisfy conservative statistical significance thresholds (i.e., two standard deviations) and 2) although natural variability and model uncertainty were separated in this analysis, the magnitude of each were roughly equivalent. Therefore, improvements in model accuracy and analysis of longer periods (assuming larger changes) are both needed for definitive mass balance change assessments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In large-scale complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system, real experiments are rarely feasible. However, a rapidly increasing amount of observational and simulated data opens up the use of novel data-driven causal methods beyond the commonly adopted correlation techniques. Here, we give an overview of causal inference frameworks and identify promising generic application cases common in Earth system sciences and beyond.

3, some ideas worth learning:
1) surface types overlay on cloud maps

3) parallax effect: good enough to do pixel vs pixel?

abstract = {The Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite was launched in April 2006 to provide global vertically resolved measurements of clouds and aerosols. Correct discrimination between clouds and aerosols observed by the lidar aboard the CALIPSO satellite is critical for accurate retrievals of cloud and aerosol optical properties and the correct interpretation of measurements. This paper reviews the theoretical basis of the CALIPSO lidar cloud and aerosol discrimination (CAD) algorithm, and describes the enhancements made to the version 2 algorithm that is used in the current data release (release 2). The paper also presents a preliminary assessment of the CAD performance based on one full day (12 August 2006) of expert manual classification and on one full month (July 2006) of the CALIOP 5-km cloud and aerosol layer products. Overall, the CAD algorithm works well in most cases. The 1-day manual verification suggests that the success rate is in the neighborhood of 90{\%} or better. Nevertheless, several specific layer types are still misclassified with some frequency. Among these, the most prevalent are dense dust and smoke close to the source regions. The analysis of the July 2006 data showed that the misclassification of dust as cloud occurs for},

abstract = {We estimate the accuracy of cloud top altitude (Z) retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) observing suite (ZA) on board the Earth Observing System Aqua platform. We compare Z(A) with coincident measurements of Z derived from the micropulse lidar and millimeter wave cloud radar at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program sites of Nauru and Manus islands (Z(ARM)) and the inferred Z from vertically resolved Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) ice water content (IWC) retrievals. The mean difference in ZA minus ZARM plus or minus one standard deviation ranges from -2.2 to 1.6 km 1.0 to 4.2 km for all cases of AIRS effective cloud fraction (f(A)) {\textgreater} 0.15 at Manus Island using the cloud radar only. The range of mean values results from using different approaches to determine Z(ARM), day/night differences, and the magnitude of f(A); the variation about the mean decreases for increasing values of f(A). Analysis of ZARM from the micropulse lidar at Nauru Island for cases restricted to 0.05 f(A) 0.15 indicates a statistically significant improvement in Z(A) - Z(ARM) over the cloud radar-derived values at Manus Island. In these cases the Z(A)-Z(ARM) difference is -1.1 to 2.1 km 3.0 to 4.5 km. These results imply that the operational Z(A) is quantitatively useful for constraining cirrus altitude despite the nominal 45 km horizontal resolution. Mean differences of cloud top pressure (P-CLD) inferred from coincident AIRS and MLS ice water content IWC) retrievals depend upon the method of defining AIRS P-CLD as with the ARM comparisons) over the MLS spatial scale, the peak altitude and maximum value of MLS IWC, and fA. AIRS and MLS yield similar vertical frequency distributions when comparisons are limited to f(A) {\textgreater} 0.1 and IWC {\textgreater} 1.0 mg m(-3). Therefore the agreement depends upon the opacity of the cloud, with decreased agreement for optically tenuous clouds. Further, the mean difference and standard deviation of AIRS and MLS PCLD are highly dependent on the MLS tangent altitude. For MLS tangent altitudes greater than 146 hPa, the strength of the limb technique, the disagreement becomes statistically significant. This implies that AIRS and MLS "agree'' in a statistical sense at lower tangent altitudes and "disagree'' at higher tangent altitudes. These results provide important insights on upper tropospheric cloudiness as observed by nadir-viewing AIRS and limb-viewing MLS.},

abstract = {The Arctic is a challenging environment for making in-situ surface radiation measurements. A standard suite of radiation sensors is typically designed to measure incoming and outgoing shortwave (SW) and thermal infrared, or longwave (LW), radiation. Enhancements may include various sensors for measuring irradiance in narrower bandwidths. Many solar radiation/thermal infrared flux sensors utilize protective glass domes and some are mounted on complex mechanical platforms (solar trackers) that keep sensors and shading devices trained on the sun along its diurnal path. High quality measurements require striking a balance between locating stations in a pristine undisturbed setting free of artificial blockage (such as from buildings and towers) and providing accessibility to allow operators to clean and maintain the instruments. Three significant sources of erroneous data in the Arctic include solar tracker malfunctions, rime/frost/snow deposition on the protective glass domes of the radiometers and operational problems due to limited operator access in extreme weather conditions. In this study, comparisons are made between the global and component sum (direct [vertical component] + diffuse) SW measurements. The difference between these two quantities (that theoretically should be zero) is used to illustrate the magnitude and seasonality of arctic radiation flux measurement problems. The problem of rime/frost/snow deposition is investigated in more detail for one case study utilizing both SW and LW measurements. Solutions to these operational problems that utilize measurement redundancy, more sophisticated heating and ventilation strategies and a more systematic program of operational support and subsequent data quality protocols are proposed.},

abstract = {Nitrogen oxides ( NO+ NO2 = NOx and reservoir species) are important trace gases in the troposphere with impact on human health, atmospheric chemistry and climate. Besides natural sources ( lightning, soil emissions) and biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion is estimated to be responsible for about 50{\%} of the total production of NOx. Since human activity in industrialized countries largely follows a seven- day cycle, fossil fuel combustion is expected to be reduced during weekends. This " weekend effect" is well known from local, ground based measurements, but has never been analysed on a global scale before. The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ( GOME) on board the ESA- satellite ERS- 2 allows measurements of NO2 column densities. By estimating and subtracting the stratospheric column, and considering radiative transfer, vertical column densities ( VCD) of tropospheric NO2 can be determined ( e. g. Leue et al., 2001). We demonstrate the statistical analysis of weekly cycles of tropospheric NO2 VCDs for different regions of the world. In the cycles of the industrialized regions and cities in the US, Europe and Japan a clear Sunday minimum of tropospheric NO2 VCD can be seen. Sunday NO2 VCDs are about 25 - 50{\%} lower than working day levels. Metropolitan areas with other religious and cultural backgrounds ( Jerusalem, Mecca) show different weekly patterns corresponding to different days of rest. In China, no weekly pattern can be found. The presence of a weekly cycle in the measured tropospheric NO2 VCD may help to identify the different anthropogenic source categories. Furthermore, we estimated the lifetime of tropospheric NO2 by analysing the mean weekly cycle exemplarily over Germany, obtaining a value of about 6 h in summer and 18 - 24 h in winter.},

abstract = {Since February 2009, an automatic weather station ({\{}AWS){\}} has been operating near Utsteinen Nunatak, north of the S{\o}r Rondane Mountains, in Dronning Maud Land at the ascent to the East Antarctic Plateau. This paper gives an assessment of the meteorological conditions, radiative fluxes, and snow accumulation for the first 2 years of operation, 2009 to 2010, analyzed in terms of meteorological regimes. Three major meteorological regimes—cold katabatic, warm synoptic, and transitional synoptic—are identified using cluster analysis based on five parameters derived from the {\{}AWS{\}} measurements (wind speed, specific humidity, near-surface temperature inversion, surface pressure, and incoming longwave flux indicative of cloud forcing). For its location, the relatively mild climate at Utsteinen can be explained by the high frequency of synoptic events (observed 41{\%}–48{\%} of the time), and a lack of drainage of cold air from the plateau due to mountain sheltering. During the cold katabatic regime, a strong surface cooling leads to a strong near-surface temperature inversion buildup. A large difference in accumulation is recorded by the {\{}AWS{\}} for the first 2 years: 235 mm water equivalent in 2009 and 27 mm water equivalent in 2010. Several large accumulation events during the warm synoptic regime occurring mainly in winter were responsible for the majority of the accumulation in 2009. Mostly, small accumulation events occurred during 2010, frequently followed by snow removal. This interannual variability in snow accumulation at the site is related to the intensity of the local synoptic events as recorded by meteorological regime characteristics.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming. To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 °C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 °C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5 °C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers. But the upper limit of climate sensitivity will be more difficult to quantify.},

The annual cycle of arctic cloud optical properties that are required to reproduce both the outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere as determined from satellite observations and the available determinations of surface radiative fluxes are derived. Existing data on cloud fraction and cloud microphysical properties are utilized. Four types of cloud are considered: low stratus clouds, midlevel clouds, cirrus clouds, and wintertime ice crystal precipitation. Internally consistent annual cycles of surface temperature, surface albedo, cloud fraction and cloud optical properties, components of surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes, and cloud radiative forcing are presented. The modeled total cloud optical depth (weighted by cloud fraction) ranges from a low value in winter of 2 to a high summertime value of 8. Infrared emmissivities for liquid water clouds are shown to be substantiafly less than unity during the cold half of the year. Values of modeled surface cloud radiative forcing are positive except for two weeks in midsummer; over the course of the year clouds have a net warning effect on the surface in the Arctic. Total cloud radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere is determined to be positive only briefly in early autumn. Surface longwave fluxes are shown to be very sensitive to the presence of lower-tropospheric ice crystal precipitation during the cold half of the year.},

The imposed perturbations act to increase the amount of heat available to melt ice, leading to a rapid Arctic sea ice retreat within 5 years after the perturbations are activated. In response, the AMOC gradually weakens over the next ∼100 years. The AMOC changes can be explained by the accumulation in the Arctic and subsequent downstream propagation to the North Atlantic of buoyancy anomalies controlled by temperature and salinity. Initially, during the first decade or so, the Arctic sea ice loss results in anomalous positive heat and salinity fluxes in the subpolar North Atlantic, inducing positive temperature and salinity anomalies over the regions of oceanic deep convection. At first, these anomalies largely compensate one another, leading to a minimal change i...},

abstract = {Meteorological observations performed in the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet during GIMEX-90/91 show the regular occurrence of moderately strong barrier-winds. The barrier wind is a thermally generated jet that develops when the large-scale flow advects warm tundra air towards the cold, melting ice sheet, creating a large local horizontal gradient of temperature. As a result, the geostrophic wind in the atmospheric boundary-layer acquires a component perpendicular to the temperature gradient. In the melting zone of the ice sheet, barrier winds interact with persistent surface-based katabatic winds. The forcing mechanisms and detailed two-dimensional structure of the barrier wind have been investigated with a mesoscale meteorological model. The model results confirm the important role of the warm tundra during the development of barrier winds. Barrier winds cause a pronounced rise in temperature and a strong increase of turbulent exchange in the lower melting zone: friction velocity and sensible-heat flux in the melting zone showed peak values of 1.3 m s -1 and 300 W m -2 respectively. In combination with large positive net radiation, the daily melt rate increased to 10 cm water equivalent, which is twice the rate in typical katabatic wind conditions. This shows that barrier winds could have a significant impact on the melt regime of areas where the ice sheet ends in the tundra. Although barrier winds in this part of Greenland may occur less frequently than the observations during GIMEX-90 suggest, they are of great importance for the climate of this and of other polar regions, such as the Antarctic, and so merit careful study.},

However, recent work has suggested that the ice sheet responds more quickly to climate perturbations than previously thought, particularly near the coast. Here we use a satellite gravity survey by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) conducted from April 2002 to April 2006 to provide an independent estimate of the contribution of Greenland ice mass loss to sea level change. We detect an ice mass loss of 248 +/- 36 km3 yr(-1), equivalent to a global sea level rise of 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1). The rate of ice loss increased by 250 per cent between the periods April 2002 to April 2004 and May 2004 to April 2006, almost entirely due to accelerated rates of ice loss in southern Greenland; the rate of mass loss in north Greenland was almost constant. Continued monitoring will be needed to identify any future changes in the rate of ice loss in Greenland.},

abstract = {A variety of numerical models for calculating the solar irradiance for an inclined surface are described and evaluated using data for Vancouver, B.C., Canada. While all the hourly models have a common approach for calculating the direct component of the solar irradiance there is a variety of methods for calculating the diffuse irradiance based on the portion of the sky hemisphere within the field of view of the surface. A less significant distinction between the models is in the methods used to calculate the amount of radiation received as a result of reflection from adjacent surfaces. The paper demonstrates that the principal features of the anisotropic distribution of sky radiance must be included in the numerical computations since the use of the unrealistic isotropic model leads to significant short and long term errors. Inclusion of directional reflectance in the slope irradiance calculations will lead to increased accuracy for the estimated values, with greatest improvement being achieved in the win...},

abstract = {Abstract This paper offers a critical review of the topic of cloud–climate feedbacks and exposes some of the underlying reasons for the inherent lack of understanding of these feedbacks and why progress might be expected on this important climate problem in the coming decade. Although many processes and related parameters come under the influence of clouds, it is argued that atmospheric processes fundamentally govern the cloud feedbacks via the relationship between the atmospheric circulations, cloudiness, and the radiative and latent heating of the atmosphere. It is also shown how perturbations to the atmospheric radiation budget that are induced by cloud changes in response to climate forcing dictate the eventual response of the global-mean hydrological cycle of the climate model to climate forcing. This suggests that cloud feedbacks are likely to control the bulk precipitation efficiency and associated responses of the planet's hydrological cycle to climate radiative forcings. The paper provides a brie...},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. Recent studies note a significant increase in high-pressure blocking over the Greenland region (Greenland Blocking Index, GBI) in summer since the 1990s. Such a general circulation change, indicated by a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, is generally highlighted as a major driver of recent surface melt records observed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Here we compare reanalysis-based GBI records with those from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) suite of global climate models over 1950–2100. We find that the recent summer GBI increase lies well outside the range of modelled past reconstructions and future GBI projections (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The models consistently project a future decrease in GBI (linked to an increase in NAO), which highlights a likely key deficiency of current climate models if the recently observed circulation changes continue to persist. Given well-established connections between atmospheric pressure over the Greenland region and air temperature and precipitation extremes downstream, e.g. over northwest Europe, this brings into question the accuracy of simulated North Atlantic jet stream changes and resulting climatological anomalies over densely populated regions of northern Europe as well as of future projections of GrIS mass balance produced using global and regional climate models.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{KESSELMEIERa,
abstract = {We measured the concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds in the atmospheric boundary layer over an equatorial African rain forest. Results obtained from a dirigible hot air balloon and a tethered balloon system in the early morning hours reflect a multilayered structure of the atmospheric boundary layer with gradients of COS and CS2 indicating an uptake/production of these trace gases by the soil/vegetation system. In addition, we studied emission and deposition fluxes of volatile reduced sulfur compounds from tropical tree species using cuvettes to directly measure the exchange behavior of tree twigs. These cuvettes were operated at young trees in a forest clearing near ground level as well as at a mature tree species on top of the forest canopy, employing a specially designed tree top jungle raft (`Treetop Raft III, Dirigible version') placed on the canopy crown. The results show qualitative and quantitative disparities between different tree species as well as between individuals of the same species near ground level (young) and at the top of the canopy (mature). We found some correlations between photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and emission of sulfur compounds. Comparison between measurements at the ground and at the canopy top show that the studied tree species adapts its photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in response to the climatic conditions at the canopy top. This is accompanied by a quantitative change in trace gas emission. Lower CO2 fixation rates are accompanied by an increase in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds. We propose the increase of DMS emission at the canopy top to be explained by a potential demand of nitrogen in the foliage resulting in an accumulation of sulfur.},

We show that atmospheric Rossby waves induce the "natural" weekend effect, which is much stronger than the "anthropogenic" weekend effect. The "natural" weekend effect does not completely disappear even with averaging over 61 years of data; as a result, true "anthropogenic" weekend effect is obscured by the natural component. We attempted to remove the "natural" component in the diurnal temperature range and the resulting pattern is an overall positive weekend effect over North America.},

1, the first paper of these data
the focus is mass balance
2, info about the weather system around GrL (cyclone)
3, aspects about temperature analysis (a lot of change/lat or altitude)
4, katabatic zones and percolation zones















Learnt:
1, climate background:
winter: baffin bay low and icelandic low (meridional winds);
cyclonic system around GrL (thermal contrast btw open ocean and ice sheet);
anti-cyclone:
1) thermal contrast
2) western coast: katabatic wind+coriolis force
3) warm current from Davis Strait
2, wind direction
3, tmp inversion: characteristics
4, Smith Sound: North Water Polynya
5, use surface height to detect storms
6, instrumentation (not the same as van den Broeke's)
but data processing is simple; just reject the impossible values
7, swiss is at the equilibrium line; jar is 28 km down the glacier
8, large tmp change during atm circulation change: spring and summer
8, firn tmp {\textless} air tmp except in percolation zone
9, mass balance factors (surface height):
scale obs surface height by snow compaction








Problems:
1, data control: maybe the datasets are not suitable for hourly research?
2, 30 C???
3, why I need the hourly data
1) diurnal change
2) run model --{\textgreater} more physical
4, wind direction change during spring over ice sheet stations
should be no change over slope stations
5, south dome: summit like wind direction but swiss like wind speed},

Observations from an automatic weather station (AWS) in the lower ablation area in South Greenland reveal the largest daily melt rates (up to 28 cm d-1 ice equivalent) ever recorded on the ice sheet. The two melt episodes lasted 6 days, equivalent to 6{\%} of the June-August melt period, but contributed 14 {\%} to the total annual ablation of 8.5 m ice equivalent. We employ a surface energy balance model driven by AWS data to quantify the relative importance of the energy budget components contributing to melt through the melt season. During the days with largest daily melt rates, surface turbulent heat input peaked at 552 Wm-2, 77 {\%} of the surface melt energy, which is otherwise typically dominated by absorbed solar radiation. We find that rain contributed ca. 7 {\%} to melt during these episodes.},

abstract = {The role of clouds remains the largest uncertainty in climate projections. They influence solar and thermal radiative transfer and the earth's water cycle. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate cloud observations to validate climate models and to monitor climate change. Passive satellite imagers measuring radiation at visible to thermal infrared (IR) wavelengths provide a wealth of information on cloud properties. Among others, the cloud top height (CTH) – a crucial parameter to estimate the thermal cloud radiative forcing – can be retrieved. In this paper we investigate the skill of ten current retrieval algorithms to estimate the CTH using observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In the first part we compare ten SEVIRI cloud top pressure (CTP) data sets with each other. The SEVIRI algorithms catch the latitudinal variation of the CTP in a similar way. The agreement is better in the extratropics than in the tropics. In the tropics multi-layer clouds and thin cirrus layers complicate the CTP retrieval, whereas a good agreement among the algorithms is found for trade wind cumulus, marine stratocumulus and the optically thick cores of the deep convective system. In the second part of the paper the SEVIRI retrievals are compared to CTH observations from the Cloud–Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) instruments. It is important to note that the different measurement techniques cause differences in the retrieved CTH data. SEVIRI measures a radiatively effective CTH, while the CTH of the active instruments is derived from the return time of the emitted radar or lidar signal. Therefore, some systematic differences are expected. On average the CTHs detected by the SEVIRI algorithms are 1.0 to 2.5 km lower than CALIOP observations, and the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the CALIOP data sets range between 0.77 and 0.90. The average CTHs derived by the SEVIRI algorithms are closer to the CPR measurements than to CALIOP measurements. The biases between SEVIRI and CPR retrievals range from −0.8 km to 0.6 km. The correlation coefficients of CPR and SEVIRI observations vary between 0.82 and 0.89. To discuss the origin of the CTH deviation, we investigate three cloud categories: optically thin and thick single layer as well as multi-layer clouds. For optically thick clouds the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the reference data sets are usually above 0.95. For optically thin single layer clouds the correlation coefficients are still above 0.92. For this cloud category the SEVIRI algorithms yield CTHs that are lower than CALIOP and similar to CPR observations. Most challenging are the multi-layer clouds, where the correlation coefficients are for most algorithms between 0.6 and 0.8. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the SEVIRI retrievals for boundary layer clouds. While the CTH retrieval for this cloud type is relatively accurate, there are still considerable differences between the algorithms. These are related to the uncertainties and limited vertical resolution of the assumed temperature profiles in combination with the presence of temperature inversions, which lead to ambiguities in the CTH retrieval. Alternative approaches for the CTH retrieval of low clouds are discussed.},

abstract = {This study seeks to explain the effects of cloud on changes in atmospheric radiative absorption that largely balance changes in global mean precipitation under climate change. The partial radiative perturbations (PRPs) due to changes in cloud and due to the effects of the pre-existing climatological cloud distribution on non-cloud changes, known as “cloud masking”, are calculated when atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled for the HadSM3 and MIROC models and for a large ensemble of parameter perturbed models based on HadSM3. Because the effect of cloud on changes in atmospheric shortwave absorption is almost negligible, longwave fluxes are analysed alone. We find that the net effects of cloud masking and cloud PRP on atmospheric absorption are both substantial. For the tropics, our results are reviewed in light of hypotheses put forward to explain cloud and radiative flux changes. We find that the major effects of clouds on radiation change are linked to known physical processes that are quite consistently simulated by models. Cloud top height changes are quite well described by the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis of Hartmann and Larson; cloud base heights change little, remaining near the same pressure. Changes in cloud geographical location and cloud amount are significant, but play a smaller role in driving radiative flux changes. Finally, because clouds are a large source of modelling uncertainty, we consider whether resolving errors in cloud simulation could reconcile modelled global mean precipitation trends of about 1–3 {\%} {\$}\backslashhbox {\{}K{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} with some estimates of observed trends of 7 {\%} {\$}\backslashhbox {\{}K{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} or more. This would require the radiative effect of clouds to change from one that increases atmospheric radiative absorption by about {\$}0.5\backslash,\backslashhbox {\{}Wm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash,\backslashhbox {\{}K{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} to one that decreases it by {\$}-3.5\backslash,\backslashhbox {\{}Wm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash,\backslashhbox {\{}K{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} . Based on our results, this seems difficult to achieve within our current rationale for the tropics at least.},

abstract = {We introduce an explicit emission tagging technique in the Community Atmosphere Model to quantify source-region-resolved characteristics of black carbon (BC), focusing on the Arctic. Explicit tagging of BC source regions without perturbing the emissions provides a physically consistent and computationally efficient approach to establish source-receptor relationships and transport pathways. Our analysis shows that the contributions of major source regions to the global BC burden are not proportional to the respective emissions due to strong region-dependent removal rates and lifetimes, while the contributions to BC direct radiative forcing show a near-linear dependence on their respective contributions to the burden. Arctic BC concentrations, deposition, and source contributions all have strong seasonal variations. Eastern Asia contributes the most to the wintertime Arctic BC burden, but has much less impact on lower-level concentrations and deposition. Northern Europe emissions are more important to both surface concentration and deposition in winter than in summer. The largest contribution to Arctic BC in the summer is from Northern Asia. Although local emissions contribute less than 10{\%} to the annual mean BC burden and deposition within the Arctic, the per-emission efficiency is much higher than for non-Arctic sources. The interannual variability (1996–2005) due tometeorology issmall in annualmean BC burden and radiative forcing but is significant in yearly seasonal means over the Arctic. When a slow aging treatment of BC is introduced, the increase of BC lifetime and burden is source dependent. Global BC forcing-per-burden efficiency also increases primarily due to changes in BC vertical distributions.},

Results from the water column of the Chesapeake Bay show no definitive seasonal trends in the sea–air flux of OCS, although these fluxes are over 50 times more than those from the open ocean. In contrast, fluxes of OCS from estuarine sediments were found to be highest in the summer, and contribute up to 75{\%} of the total sources of OCS in this estuary. Laboratory incubations of Chesapeake Bay sediments using different carbon substrates, inhibitors, and temperature show that OCS production is coupled to microbial sulfate reduction. These results explain the high sediment porewater concentrations and high sediment–water fluxes in the summer, and combined with the field data, provide evidence that anoxic sediments can be an important component of the OCS budget in coastal waters.},

abstract = {The most common rainfall measuring sensor for validation of radar-rainfall products is the rain gauge. However, the difference between area-rainfall and rain gauge point-rainfall estimates imposes additional noise in the radar-rain gauge difference statistics, which should not be interpreted as radar error. A methodology is proposed to quantify the radar-rainfall error variance by seperating the variance of the rain-gauge area-point rainfall difference from the variance of radar-rain gauge ratio. The error in this research is defined as the ratio of the "true" rainfall to the estimated mean-areal rainfall by radar and rain gauge. Both radar and rain gauge multiplicative errors are assumed to be stochastic variables, lognormally distributed, with zero covariance. The rain gauge area-point difference variance is quantified based on the areal-rainfall variance reduction factor evaluated in the logarithmic domain. The statistical method described here has two distinct characteristics: first it ptoposes a range-dependent formulation of the error variance, and second, the error variance estimates are relative to the mean rainfall as the radar product grids. Two months of radar and rain gauge data from the Melbourne, Florida, WSR-88D are used to illustrate the proposed method. The study concentrates on hourly accumulations at 2- and 4-km grid resolutions. Results show that the area-point difference in rain gauge rainfall contributes up to 60{\%} of the variance observed in radar-rain gauge differences, depending on the radar grid size, the location of the sampling point in the grid, and the distance from the radar.},

abstract = {The areal extent, concentration and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas have strongly decreased during the recent decades, but cold, snow-rich winters have been common over mid-latitude land areas since 2005. A review is presented on studies addressing the local and remote effects of the sea ice decline on weather and climate. It is evident that the reduction in sea ice cover has increased the heat flux from the ocean to atmosphere in autumn and early winter. This has locally increased air tempera- ture, moisture, and cloud cover and reduced the static stability in the lower troposphere. Several studies based on observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and model experiments suggest that the sea ice decline, together with increased snow cover in Eurasia, favours circulation patterns resembling the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation. The suggested large-scale pressure patterns include a high over Eurasia, which favours cold winters in Europe and northeastern Eurasia. A high over the western and a low over the eastern North America have also been suggested, favouring advection of Arctic air masses to North America. Mid-latitude winter weather is, however, affected by several other factors, which generate a large inter-annual variability and often mask the effects of sea ice decline. In addition, the small sample of years with a large sea ice loss makes it difficult to distinguish the effects directly attributable to sea ice conditions. Several studies suggest that, with advancing global warming, cold winters in mid-latitude continents will no longer be common during the second half of the twenty-first century. Recent studies have also suggested causal links between the sea ice decline and summer precipitation in Europe, the Mediterranean, and East Asia.},

However, in the winter season, precipitation shows a monotonic increase from Sunday to a maximum on Thursday, while maximum temperature shows a monotonic decrease from Monday to a Saturday minimum. Winter weekday precipitation is significantly (at the 5{\%} level) greater than weekend precipitation, the reason for which seems to be atmospheric pollution.

The clear-sky comparisons included eight simple LW parameterizations, which mainly use screen-level input data, and four radiation schemes from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models: The former European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) scheme, the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) scheme, the High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) scheme, and the new ECMWF LW scheme (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model, RRTM). Atmospheric-sounding profiles were used as input for the NWP schemes. For the cases with clouds, three simple cloud-correction methods were tested. Almost all LW schemes usually underestimated the downwelling clear-sky flux, particularly, in cold (surface inversion) conditions. Overall, the RRTM scheme performed best. The simple cloud-correction methods turned out to be useful in the LW region. Finally, some new simple parameterization formulas were developed using the present data. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The exchange of carbonyl sulfide (COS) between soil and the atmosphere was investigated for three arable soils from Germany, China and Finland and one forest soil from Siberia for parameterization in the relation to ambient carbonyl sulfide (COS) concentration, soil water content (WC) and air temperature. All investigated soils acted as sinks for COS. A clear and distinct uptake optimum was found for the German, Chinese, Finnish and Siberian soils at 11.5{\%}, 9{\%}, 11.5{\%}, and 9{\%} soil WC, respectively, indicating that the soil WC acts as an important biological and physical parameter for characterizing the exchange of COS between soils and the atmosphere. Different optima of deposition velocities (V(d)) as observed for the Chinese, Finnish and Siberian boreal soil types in relation to their soil WC, aligned at 19{\%} in relation to the water-filled pore space (WFPS), indicating the dominating role of gas diffusion. This interpretation was supported by the linear correlation between V(d) and bulk density. We suggest that the uptake of COS depends on the diffusivity dominated by WFPS, a parameter depending on soil WC, soil structure and porosity of the soil.},

abstract = {The surface energy balance of sea ice was measured during three one-week periods in November, January, and February of 1980-81 in the Barrow Strait, Northwest Territories, Canada. Turbulent fluxes were derived with the bulk aerodynamic transfer method, using temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed profile measurements. The conductive heat flux was balanced by the sensible and latent heat fluxes, and by the radiative fluxes for all three measuring periods. In November, when there was a mean ice thickness of 0.32 m, approximately 80{\%} ± 6{\%} of the conductive heat flux (-129 W m-2) was dissipated by the sensible heat flux (108 W m-2), approximately 20{\%} ± 8{\%} of the energy was lost by longwave radiation (30 W m-2), and the latent heat flux (6 W m-2) accounted for 4{\%} of the total surface energy balance. Ice growth rates could be predicted for young ice with an accuracy of 10{\%}, based on conductive flux measurements. Brine-wetted snow on sea ice increased the conductive heat flux to two times that of pure snow. In January, when there was a mean ice thickness of 0.92 m, approximately 50{\%} ± 9{\%} of the conductive heat flux (-50 W m-2) was dissipated by sensible heat flux (26 W m-2), approximately 50{\%} ± 9{\%} was dissipated by radiative cooling (27 W m-2), and the latent heat flux had a mean value of O W m-2. Variations in the surface energy balance tend to be related to synoptic events, such as the horizontal advection of warm air and the increased cloudiness of transient eddies. In February, the mean conductive heat flux was -36 ± 4 W m-2, which was balanced by the radiative flux of 32 ± 2.5 W m-2 (80{\%} ± 8{\%}) and by the sensible flux of 10 W m-2 (20{\%} ± 6{\%}). Again, large-scale synoptic events dominated the surface energy balance. On a weekly basis, the mean surface energy balance residuals were within the predicted uncertainties, based on instrument resolution.},

abstract = {Arctic boundary-layer clouds were investigated with remote sensing and in situ instruments during the Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol, Clouds and Radiation (ASTAR) campaign in March and April 2007. The clouds formed in a cold air outbreak over the open Greenland Sea. Beside the predominant mixed-phase clouds pure liquid water and ice clouds were observed. Utilizing measurements of solar radiation reflected by the clouds three methods to retrieve the thermodynamic phase of the cloud are introduced and compared. Two ice indices I-S and I-P were obtained by analyzing the spectral pattern of the cloud top reflectance in the near infrared (1500-1800 nm wavelength) spectral range which is characterized by ice and water absorption. While I-S analyzes the spectral slope of the reflectance in this wavelength range, IP utilizes a principle component analysis (PCA) of the spectral reflectance. A third ice index I-A is based on the different side scattering of spherical liquid water particles and nonspherical ice crystals which was recorded in simultaneous measurements of spectral cloud albedo and reflectance. Radiative transfer simulations show that I-S, I-P and I-A range between 5 to 80, 0 to 8 and 1 to 1.25 respectively with lowest values indicating pure liquid water clouds and highest values pure ice clouds. The spectral slope ice index I-S and the PCA ice index I-P are found to be strongly sensitive to the effective diameter of the ice crystals present in the cloud. Therefore, the identification of mixed-phase clouds requires a priori knowledge of the ice crystal dimension. The reflectance-albedo ice index IA is mainly dominated by the uppermost cloud layer (tau {\textless} 1.5). Therefore, typical boundary-layer mixed-phase clouds with a liquid cloud top layer will be identified as pure liquid water clouds. All three methods were applied to measurements above a cloud field observed during ASTAR 2007. The comparison with independent in situ microphysical measurements shows the ability of the three approaches to identify the ice phase in Arctic boundary-layer clouds.},

abstract = {Rivers are the dominant source of many elements and isotopes to the ocean. But this input from the continents is not balanced by the loss of the elements and isotopes through hydrothermal and sedimentary exchange with the oceanic crust, or by temporal changes in the marine inventory for elements that are demonstrably not in steady state. To resolve the problem of the observed imbalance in marine geochemical budgets, attention has been focused on uncertainties in the hydrothermal and sedimentary fluxes. In recent Earth history, temporally dynamic chemical weathering fluxes from the continents are an inevitable consequence of periodic glaciations. Chemical weathering rates on modern Earth are likely to remain far from equilibrium owing to the physical production of finely ground material at glacial terminations that acts as a fertile substrate for chemical weathering. Here we explore the implications of temporal changes in the riverine chemical weathering flux for oceanic geochemical budgets. We contend that the riverine flux obtained from observations of modern rivers is broadly accurate, but not representative of timescales appropriate for elements with oceanic residence longer than Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. We suggest that the pulse of rapid chemical weathering initiated at the last deglaciation has not yet decayed away and that weathering rates remain about two to three times the average for an entire late Quaternary glacial cycle. Taking into account the effect of the suggested non-steady-state process on the silicate weathering flux helps to reconcile the modelled marine strontium isotope budget with available data. Overall, we conclude that consideration of the temporal variability in riverine fluxes largely ameliorates long-standing problems with chemical and isotopic mass balances in the ocean.},

Significant (confidence level 95{\%}) COS emission was only detected from rapeseed leaves at COS mixing ratios lower than 90 pptv. We computed COS compensation points around 90 (57-135) pptv and 144 (0-328) pptv COS for rapeseed and corn. For both plant species we found a close correlation between the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and the COS uptake. In contrast to the gas exchange studies with corn and rapeseed, experiments with pea plants revealed neither a change in response to increased COS concentrations of between 350 and 900 pptv COS nor any correlation with photosynthesis. However, for all three plants studied we found indications that COS is taken up preferentially over CO2 under normal ambient conditions.},

An Arctic-specific, ground-based, multisensor cloud retrieval system is described here and applied to 2 yr of observations from Barrow, Alaska. Over these 2 yr, clouds occurred 75{\%} of the time, with cloud ice and liquid each occurring nearly 60{\%} of the time. Liquid water occurred at least 25{\%} of the time, even in winter, and existed up to heights of 8 km. The vertically integrated mass of liquid was typically larger than that of ice. While it is generally difficult to evaluate the overall uncertainty of a comprehensive cloud retrieval system of this type, radiative flux closure analyses were performed in which flux calculations using the derived microphysical properties were compared with measurements at the surface and the top of the atmosphere.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to foster the development of an end-to-end uncertainty analysis framework that can quantify satellite-based precipitation estimation error characteristics and to assess the influence of the error propagation into hydrological simulation. First, the error associated with the satellite-based precipitation estimates is assumed as a nonlinear function of rainfall space-time integration scale, rain intensity, and sampling frequency. Parameters of this function are determined by using high-resolution satellite-based precipitation estimates and gauge-corrected radar rainfall data over the southwestern United States. Parameter sensitivity analysis at 16 selected 5{\textordmasculine} x 5{\textordmasculine} latitude- longitude grids shows about 12–16{\%} of variance of each parameter with respect to its mean value. Afterward, the influence of precipitation estimation error on the uncertainty of hydrological response is further examined with Monte Carlo simulation. By this approach, 100 ensemble members of precipitation data are generated, as forcing input to a conceptual rainfall-runoff hydrologic model, and the resulting uncertainty in the streamflow prediction is quantified. Case studies are demonstrated over the Leaf River basin in Mississippi. Compared with conventional procedure, i.e., precipitation estimation error as fixed ratio of rain rates, the proposed framework provides more realistic quantification of precipitation estimation error and offers improved uncertainty assessment of the error propagation into hydrologic simulation. Further study shows that the radar rainfall- generated streamflow sequences are consistently contained by the uncertainty bound of satellite rainfall generated streamflow at the 95{\%} confidence interval},

abstract = {In this paper the influence of 3D effect on snow reflection function (SRF) and albedo is studied in the framework of the stochastic radiative transfer theory. In particular, the corresponding equations for the averaged intensity of reflected light are solved for the ensemble of realizations of the stochastic field ??(r), describing the distribution of 3D elements on the flat semi-infinite snow layer (SISL). The reflection from the underlying SISL is modeled using the solution of the 1D radiative transfer equation. The corresponding look-up tables were compiled beforehand and used in the simulation process. In accordance with the previous studies, it was found that the albedo of snow layer is reduced (in particular, in the infrared region), if 3D effects are taken into account. There is no such a reduction, if light absorption in snow is absent. The 3D effects may increase or decrease SRF depending on the sastrugi fraction and illumination/observation conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present four years (August 2003-August 2007) of surface mass balance data from the ablation zone of the west Greenland ice sheet along the 67 {\&} deg; N latitude circle. Sonic height rangers and automatic weather stations continuously measured accumulation/ablation and near-surface climate at distances of 6, 38 and 88 km from the ice sheet margin at elevations of 490, 1020 and 1520 m a.s.l. Using a melt model and reasonable assumptions about snow density and percolation characteristics, these data are used to quantify the partitioning of energy and mass fluxes during melt episodes. The lowest site receives very little winter accumulation, and ice melting is nearly continuous in June, July and August. Due to the lack of snow accumulation, little refreezing occurs and virtually all melt energy is invested in runoff. Higher up the ice sheet, the ice sheet surface freezes up during the night, making summer melting intermittent. At the intermediate site, refreezing in snow consumes about 10{\%} of the melt energy, increasing to 40{\%} at the highest site. The sum of these effects is that total melt and runoff increase exponentially towards the ice sheet margin, each time doubling between the stations. At the two lower sites, we estimate that radiation penetration causes 20-30{\%} of the ice melt to occur below the surface. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2008.},

Nearly three years of data (January 2011–October 2013) are used to characterize the annual cycle of surface radiative fluxes and cloud radiative forcing (CRF) from the central Greenland Ice Sheet at Summit Station. The annual average CRF is 33 W m−2, representing a substantial net cloud warming of the central Greenland surface. Unlike at other Arctic sites, clouds warm the surface during the summer. The surface albedo is high at Summit throughout the year, limiting the cooling effect of the shortwave CRF and thus the total CRF is dominated by cloud longwave warming effects in all months. All monthly mean CRF values are positive (warming), as are 98.5{\%} of 3-hourly cases. The annual cycle of CRF is largely driven by the occurrence of liquid-bearing clouds, with a minimum in spring and maximum in late summer. Optically thick liqu...},

@article{Miller2017a,
abstract = {Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures are controlled by an exchange of energy at the surface, which includes radiative, turbulent, and ground heat fluxes. Data collected by multiple projects are leveraged to calculate all surface energy budget (SEB) terms at Summit, Greenland, for the full annual cycle from July 2013 to June 2014 and extend to longer periods for the radiative and turbulent SEB terms. Radiative fluxes are measured directly by a suite of broadband radiometers. Turbulent sensible heat flux is estimated via the bulk aerodynamic and eddy correlation methods, and the turbulent latent heat flux is calculated via a two-level approach using measurements at 10 and 2 m. The subsurface heat flux is calculated using a string of thermistors buried in the snow pack. Extensive quality-control data processing produced a data set in which all terms of the SEB are present 75 {\%} of the full annual cycle, despite the harsh conditions. By including a storage term for a near-surface layer, the SEB is balanced in this data set to within the aggregated uncertainties for the individual terms. November and August case studies illustrate that surface radiative forcing is driven by synoptically forced cloud characteristics, especially by low-level, liquid-bearing clouds. The annual cycle and seasonal diurnal cycles of all SEB components indicate that the non-radiative terms are anticorrelated to changes in the total radiative flux and are hence responding to cloud radiative forcing. Generally, the non-radiative SEB terms and the upwelling longwave radiation component compensate for changes in downwelling radiation, although exact partitioning of energy in the response terms varies with season and near-surface characteristics such as stability and moisture availability. Substantial surface warming from low-level clouds typically leads to a change from a very stable to a weakly stable near-surface regime with no solar radiation or from a weakly stable to neutral/unstable regime with solar radiation. Relationships between forcing terms and responding surface fluxes show that the upwelling longwave radiation produces 65–85 {\%} (50–60 {\%}) of the total response in the winter (summer) and the non-radiative terms compensate for the remaining change in the combined downwelling longwave and net shortwave radiation. Because melt conditions are rarely reached at Summit, these relationships are documented for conditions of surface temperature below 0 °C, with and without solar radiation. This is the first time that forcing and response term relationships have been investigated in detail for the Greenland SEB. These results should both advance understanding of process relationships over the Greenland Ice Sheet and be useful for model validation.},

abstract = {The albedo of the Greenland ice sheet plays a key role in the energy balance and climate of the arctic. Change in snow albedo values associated with changing climate conditions can be monitored remotely from satellite platforms viewing the entire Greenland ice sheet, yet comparisons to high quality surface measurements are necessary to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as new snow albedo algorithms are developed with higher spatial and temporal resolution. During May, June, and July 2011, we obtained daily measurements of spectral albedo at Summit, Greenland with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer, scanning at 350-2200 nm. We compare our spectral albedo field measurements to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), using both the Version 005 Direct Broadcast daily albedo product and the recently developed Version 006 MCD43A daily albedo product. The spectral field measurements allow calculation of weighted integrals to compare to seven MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging the UV through Infrared, as well as a broadband integration to compare to the MODIS shortwave albedo. We additionally compare our field measurements to albedo measured at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station at Summit. Using the MODIS Version 005 Direct Broadcast product, high-quality retrievals only, comparison to field measurements results in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.033 for the MODIS shortwave product, and RMSE for the MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging 0.022-0.077. The new MODIS Version 006 product shows considerable improvement, with shortwave RMSE of 0.026, and narrow bandwidths ranging 0.020-0.048. These error values for the Version 006 albedo product show an improvement in reported error values from previous MODIS field validations in Greenland, which have been limited to broadband data from the Greenland Climate Network Automatic Weather Stations.

The NORLAM is able to simulate the synoptic developments and daily cycle of the katabatic wind system realistically. For most of the cases covered by aircraft observations, the model results agree very well with the measured developments and structures of the katabatic wind system in the lowest 400 m. Despite NORLAM's general ability of reproducing the four-dimensional structure of the katabatic wind, problems occur in cases, when the synoptic background is not well captured by the analyses used as initial and boundary conditions for the model runs or where NORLAM fails to correctly predict the synoptic development. The katabatic wind intensity in the stable boundary layer is underestimated by the model in cases when the simulated synoptic forcing is too weak. An additional problem becomes obvious in cases when the model simulates clouds in contrast to the observations or when the simulated clouds are too thick compared to the observed cloud cover. In these cases, the excessive cloud amount prevents development of the katabatic wind in the model.},

Fire has been burning ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping to shape global biome distribution and to maintain the structure and function of fire-prone communities. Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world. Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation. We point to the common questions, and some surprisingly different answers, that emerge from viewing fire as a globally significant consumer that is analogous to herbivory.},

@article{McIlhattan2017,
abstract = {AbstractClouds are a key regulator of Earth?s surface energy balance. The presence or absence of clouds, along with their macroscale and microscale characteristics are the primary factors modulating the amount of radiation incident on the surface. Recent observational studies in the Arctic highlight the ubiquity of supercooled liquid containing clouds (LCCs) and their disproportionately large impact on surface melt. Global climate models (GCMs) do not simulate enough Arctic LCCs compared to observations, and thus fail to represent the surface energy balance correctly. This work utilizes space-borne observations from NASA?s A-Train satellite constellation to explore physical processes behind LCC and surface energy biases in the Community Earth Systems Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) project output. On average CESM-LE underestimates LCC frequency by ?18{\%} over the Arctic, resulting in a ?20 W m?2 bias in downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) over the ?18?106 km2 area examined. Collocated observations of falling snow and LCCs indicate that Arctic LCCs produce precipitation ?13{\%} of the time. Conversely, CESM-LE generates snow in ?70{\%} of LCCs. This result indicates that the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process?the growth of ice at the expense of supercooled liquid?may be too strong in the model, causing ice to scavenge polar supercooled cloud liquid too efficiently. Ground-based observations from Summit Station, Greenland provide further evidence of these biases on a more local scale suggesting that CESM-LE overestimates snow frequency in LCCs by ?52{\%} at the center of the ice sheet leading to ?21{\%} too few LCCs and ?24 W m?2 too little DLR.},

abstract = {AbstractOver recent decades sea ice and snow cover extent has significantly declined across the Arctic. The melting has been confirmed using numerous observational tools. While climate models also tend to predict melting trends a wide range of projections manifest due to uncertainties in Arctic processes. Causes for the rapid loss of sea ice are complex and linked to the surface radiation budget through cloud and sea-ice feedbacks. To improve assessments of the Arctic energy budget for validation and scientific study we have developed the Arctic Observation and Reanalysis Integrated System (ArORIS). ArOIS merges together numerous state-of-the-art satellite, reanalysis, and in-situ datasets from peer-reviewed products using a conventional grid (2.5° spatial resolution averaged over a monthly timescale interval) and name-labeling framework. Primary variables include state-of-the art satellite retrieved cloud properties, radiation fluxes (top and bottom of atmosphere), surface precipitation rates, and snow and sea ice extents. The dataset is geared for scientific inquiry, product validation, and assessment of the radiation and moisture budgets in the Arctic.},

New records of monthly mean zonal winds at 500 hPa and of the maximum latitude of ridge peaks of the 5,700±50 m isohypse over the Arctic were associated with the formation and persistency of a cutoff high. The unprecedented (1948–2015) and sustained atmospheric conditions promoted enhanced runoff, increased the surface temperatures and decreased the albedo in northern Greenland, while inhibiting melting in the south, where new melting records were set over the past decade.},

The total 2000-2008 mass loss of approximately 1500 gigatons, equivalent to 0.46 millimeters per year of global sea level rise, is equally split between surface processes (runoff and precipitation) and ice dynamics. Without the moderating effects of increased snowfall and refreezing, post-1996 Greenland ice sheet mass losses would have been 100{\%} higher. Since 2006, high summer melt rates have increased Greenland ice sheet mass loss to 273 gigatons per year (0.75 millimeters per year of equivalent sea level rise). The seasonal cycle in surface mass balance fully accounts for detrended GRACE mass variations, confirming insignificant subannual variation in ice sheet discharge.},

abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since the mid-1990s. This has been due to both increased ice discharge into the ocean and melting at the surface, with the latter being the dominant contribution. This change in state has been attributed to rising temperatures and a decrease in surface albedo. We show, using satellite data and climate model output, that the abrupt reduction in surface mass balance since about 1995 can be attributed largely to a coincident trend of decreasing summer cloud cover enhancing the melt-albedo feedback. Satellite observations show that, from 1995 to 2009, summer cloud cover decreased by 0.9 ± 0.3{\%} per year. Model output indicates that the GrIS summer melt increases by 27 ± 13 gigatons (Gt) per percent reduction in summer cloud cover, principally because of the impact of increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone. The observed reduction in cloud cover is strongly correlated with a state shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation promoting anticyclonic conditions in summer and suggests that the enhanced surface mass loss from the GrIS is driven by synoptic-scale changes in Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of the beta-test MODIS (MOD10A1) daily albedo product using in situ data collected in Greenland during summer 2004. Results indicate the beta-test product tracks the general seasonal variability in albedo but exhibits significant more temporal variability than observed at the stations. This may indicate problems with the cloud detection algorithm, and/or failure of the BRDF model to adequately model the bidirectional reflectance of snow. Comparisons with in situ observations at five automatic weather stations in Greenland indicate an overall RMSE of 0.067 for the Terra instrument and an RMSE of 0.075 on Aqua. The Terra-retrieved-albedo are slightly better correlated with the in situ data than the Aqua retrievals (r=0.79 versus r=0.77). Comparisons were also made between the MODIS daily albedo product and the MODIS 16-day albedo product (MOD43133). Results indicate general correspondence between the two products, with better agreement found using the Terra-retrieved-albedo than the Aqua-retrieved albedo. The reason for the differences in albedo between the Aqua and Terra satellites remains unclear. At the stations examined, both the Terra and Aqua retrievals were made at nearly the same time of the day and therefore the differences in albedo between the satellites cannot be explained by differences in solar illumination. Finally, the albedo derived using MODIS data and the direct estimation algorithm (DEA) was also compared with 2004 Greenland in situ data. Results from this comparison suggest that the DEA performs well as long as the solar zenith angle of the observation is not greater than 70 degrees. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the trend of amplified warming in the Arctic, we examine the observed and modeled top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative responses to surface air-temperature changes over the Arctic by using TOA energy fluxes from NASA's CERES observations and those from twelve climate models in CMIP5. Considerable inter-model spreads in the radiative responses suggest that future Arctic warming may be determined by the compensation between the radiative imbalance and poleward energy transport (mainly via transient eddy activities). The poleward energy transport tends to prevent excessive Arctic warming: the transient eddy activities are weakened because of the reduced meridional temperature gradient under polar amplification. However, the models that predict rapid Arctic warming do not realistically simulate the compensation effect. This role of energy compensation in future Arctic warming is found only when the inter-model differences in cloud radiative effects are considered. Thus, the dynamical response can act as a buffer to prevent excessive Arctic warming against the radiative response of 0.11 W m−2 K−1 as measured from satellites, which helps the Arctic climate system retain an Arctic climate sensitivity of 4.61 K. Therefore, if quantitative analyses of the observations identify contribution of atmospheric dynamics and cloud effects to radiative imbalance, the satellite-measured radiative response will be a crucial indicator of future Arctic warming.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

A new collection of initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) generated with seven Earth system models under historical and future radiative forcing scenarios provides new insights into uncertainties due to internal variability versus model differences. These data enhance the assessment of climate change risks, including extreme events, and offer a powerful testbed for new methodologies aimed at separating forced signals from internal variability in the observational record. Opportunities and challenges confronting the design and dissemination of future LEs, including increased spatial resolution and model complexity alongside emerging Earth system applications, are discussed. Climate change detection is confounded by internal variability, but recent initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) have begun addressing this issue. This Perspective discusses the value of multi-model LEs, the challenges of providing them and their role in future climate change research.},

abstract = {Four different types of estimates of the surface downwelling longwave radiative flux (DLR) are reviewed. One group of estimates synthesizes global cloud, aerosol, and other information in a radiation model that is used to calculate fluxes. Because these synthesis fluxes have been assessed against observations, the global- mean values of these fluxes are deemed to be the most credible of the four different categories reviewed. The global, annual mean DLR lies between approximately 344 and 350 W m22 with an error of approximately 610 W m22 that arises mostly from the uncertainty in atmospheric state that governs the estimation of the clear-sky emission. The authors conclude that theDLRderived from global climate models are biased low by approximately 10 W m22 and even larger differences are found with respect to reanalysis climate data. The DLR inferred from a surface energy balance closure is also substantially smaller that the range found from synthesis products suggesting that current depictions of surface energy balance also require revision. The effect of clouds on the DLR, largely facilitated by the new cloud base information from the CloudSat radar, is estimated to lie in the range from 24 to 34 W m22 for the global cloud radiative effect (all-sky minus clear-sky DLR). This effect is strongly modulated by the underlying water vapor that gives rise to a maximum sensi- tivity of the DLR to cloud occurring in the colder drier regions of the planet. The bottom of atmosphere (BOA) cloud effect directly contrast the effect of clouds on the top of atmosphere (TOA) fluxes that is maximum in regions of deepest and coldest clouds in the moist tropics.},

abstract = {Within the framework of lower order thermodynamic theories for the climatic evolution of Arctic sea ice we isolate the conditions required for the existence of stable seasonally-varying solutions, in which ice forms each winter and melts away each summer. This is done by constructing a two-season model from the continuously evolving theory of Eisenman and Wettlaufer (2009) and showing that seasonally-varying states are unstable under constant annual average short-wave radiative forcing. However, dividing the summer season into two intervals (ice covered and ice free) provides sufficient freedom to stabilize seasonal ice. Simple perturbation theory shows that the condition for stability is determined by the timing of when the ice vanishes in summer and hence the relative magnitudes of the summer heat flux over the ocean versus over the ice. This scenario is examined within the context of greenhouse gas warming, as a function of which stability conditions are discerned.},

abstract = {Understanding the variability of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle is central to determining the potential for extreme events and susceptibility to future change. In the absence of long-term, large-scale observations of the components of the hydrologic cycle, modeling can provide consistent fields of land surface fluxes and states. This paper describes the creation of a global, 50-yr, 3-hourly, 1.0° dataset of meteorological forcings that can be used to drive models of land surface hydrology. The dataset is constructed by combining a suite of global observation-based datasets with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis. Known biases in the reanalysis precipitation and near-surface meteorology have been shown to exert an erroneous effect on modeled land surface water and energy budgets and are thus corrected using observation-based datasets of precipitation, air temperature, and radiation. Corrections are also made to the rain day statistics of the reanalysis precipitation, which have been found to exhibit a spurious wavelike pattern in high-latitude wintertime. Wind-induced undercatch of solid precipitation is removed using the results from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Measurement Intercomparison. Precipitation is disaggregated in space to 1.0° by statistical downscaling using relationships developed with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) daily product. Disaggregation in time from daily to 3 hourly is accomplished similarly, using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3-hourly real-time dataset. Other meteorological variables (downward short- and longwave radiation, specific humidity, surface air pressure, and wind speed) are downscaled in space while accounting for changes in elevation. The dataset is evaluated against the biascorrected forcing dataset of the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP2). The final product provides a long-term, globally consistent dataset of near-surface meteorological variables that can be used to drive models of the terrestrial hydrologic and ecological processes for the study of seasonal and interannual variability and for the evaluation of coupled models and other land surface prediction schemes.},

abstract = {Surface melt and mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet may play crucial roles in global climate change due to their positive feedbacks and large fresh-water storage. With few other regular meteorological observations available in this extreme environment, measurements from automatic weather stations (AWS) are the primary data source for studying surface energy budgets, and for validating satellite observations and model simulations. Station tilt, due to irregular surface melt, compaction and glacier dynamics, causes considerable biases in the AWS shortwave radiation measurements. In this study, we identify tilt-induced biases in the climatology of surface shortwave radiative flux and albedo, and retrospectively correct these by iterative application of solar geometric principles. We found, over all the AWS from the Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net), the Kangerlussuaq transect (K-transect) and the Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) networks, insolation on fewer than 40 {\%} of clear days peaks within {\&}pm;0.5 h of solar noon time, with the largest shift exceeding 3 h due to tilt. Hourly absolute biases in the magnitude of surface insolation can reach up to 200 W m−2, with respect to the well-understood clear-day insolation. We estimate the tilt angles and their directions based on the solar geometric relationship between the simulated insolation at a horizontal surface and the observed insolation by these tilted AWS under clear-sky conditions. Our adjustment reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) against references from both satellite observation and reanalysis by 16 W m−2 (24 {\%}), and raises the correlation coefficients with them to above 0.95. Averaged over the whole Greenland Ice Sheet in the melt season, the adjustment in insolation to compensate station tilt is ∼ 11 W m−2, enough to melt 0.24 m of snow water equivalent. The adjusted diurnal cycles of albedo are smoother, with consistent semi-smiling patterns. The seasonal cycles and inter-annual variabilities of albedo agree better with previous studies. This tilt-corrected shortwave radiation data set derived using the Retrospective, Iterative, Geometry-Based (RIGB) method provide more accurate observations and validations for surface energy budgets studies on the Greenland Ice Sheet, including albedo variations, surface melt simulations and cloud radiative forcing estimates.},

abstract = {AbstractDuring the past three decades, the most rapid warming at the surface has occurred during the Arctic winter. By analyzing daily ERA-Interim data, it is found that the majority of the winter warming trend north of 70°N can be explained by the trend in the downward infrared radiation (IR). This downward IR trend can be attributed to an enhanced poleward flux of moisture and sensible heat into the Arctic by poleward-propagating Rossby waves, which increases the total column water and temperature within this region. This enhanced moisture flux is mostly due to changes in the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation rather than an increase in moisture in lower latitudes. The results of this study lead to the question of whether Arctic amplification has mostly arisen through changes in the Rossby wave response to greenhouse gas forcing and its impact on moisture transport into the Arctic.},

abstract = {An earlier paper by Bell et al. (2008) showed satellite evidence that average summertime (1998-2005) rainfall over the noncoastal southeast U. S. varied with the day of the week in a statistically significant way, with the maximum occurring midweek (Tuesday-Thursday). An explanation was proposed in which the recurring midweek increase in air pollution over the area causes a shift in the drop size distribution in clouds to smaller sizes as the clouds develop. The smaller droplets could be carried to higher altitudes where their freezing releases additional latent heat, invigorating the storms. Evidence for this phenomenon was provided by storm height distributions obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission radar, but the statistical significance of the midweek increase in storm heights was unclear. An improved statistical analysis of the storm height distributions is provided here, indicating that the probability that storms climb above altitudes of 7-15 km is increased midweek relative to weekends (Saturday-Monday) for afternoon storms (1200-2400 LT). The morning storm heights, on the other hand, are found not to exhibit statistically significant shifts, which would be consistent with the above explanation. Morning storm statistics are also found to be much more sensitive than afternoon storm statistics to the exact area over which the averages are taken.},

abstract = {The Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder (APP) data provides the first long-time series of consistent, calibrated surface albedo and surface temperature data for the polar regions. Validations of these products have consisted of individual studies that analyzed algorithm performance for limited regions and or time periods. This article reports on comparisons made between the APP-derived surface albedo and that measured at 14 automatic weather stations (AWS) around the Greenland ice sheet from January 1997 to August 1998. Results show that satellite-derived surface albedo values are on average 10{\%} less than those measured by the AWS stations. However, the station measurements tend to be biased high by about 4{\%} and thus the differences in absolute albedo may be less (e.g., 6{\%}). In regions of the ice sheet where the albedo variability is small, such as the dry snow facies, the APP albedo uncertainty exceeds the natural variability. Further work is needed to improve the absolute accuracy of the APP-derived surface albedo. Even so, the data provide temporally and spatially consistent estimates of the Greenland ice sheet albedo. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The summer extent of the Arctic sea-ice cover has decreased in recent decades and there have been alterations in the timing and duration of the summer melt season. These changes in ice conditions have affected the partitioning of solar radiation in the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system. The impact of sea-ice changes on solar partitioning is examined on a pan-Arctic scale using a 25 km x 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid for the years 1979-2007. Daily values of incident solar irradiance are obtained from NCEP reanalysis products adjusted by ERA-40, and ice concentrations are determined from passive microwave satellite data. The albedo of the ice is parameterized by a five-stage process that includes dry snow, melting snow, melt pond formation, melt pond evolution, and freeze-up. The timing of these stages is governed by the onset dates of summer melt and fall freeze-up, which are determined from satellite observations. Trends of solar heat input to the ice were mixed, with increases due to longer melt seasons and decreases due to reduced ice concentration. Results indicate a general trend of increasing solar heat input to the Arctic ice-ocean system due to declines in albedo induced by decreases in ice concentration and longer melt seasons. The evolution of sea-ice albedo, and hence the total solar heating of the ice-ocean system, is more sensitive to the date of melt onset than the date of fall freeze-up. The largest increases in total annual solar heat input from 1979 to 2007, averaging as much as 4{\%} a(-1), occurred in the Chukchi Sea region. The contribution of solar heat to the ocean is increasing faster than the contribution to the ice due to the loss of sea ice.},

abstract = {Under stable meteorological conditions the effect of ship-stack exhaust on overlying clouds was detected in daytime satellite images as an enhancement in cloud reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers. The exhaust is a source of cloud-condensation nuclei that increases the number of cloud droplets while reducing droplet size. This reduction in droplet size causes the reflectivity at 3.7 micrometers to be greater than the levels for nearby noncontaminated clouds of similar physical characteristics. The increase in droplet number causes the reflectivity at 0.63 micrometer to be significantly higher for the contaminated clouds despite the likelihood that the exhaust is a source of particles that absorb at visible wavelengths. The effect of aerosols on cloud reflectivity is expected to have a larger influence on the earth's albedo than that due to the direct scattering and absorption of sunlight by the aerosols alone.},

abstract = {Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) surface meteorological observations are used to estimate net surface water vapor flux at ice sheet sites. Results from aerodynamic profile methods are compared with eddy correlation and evaporation pan measurements. Two profile method types are applied to hourly data sets spanning 1995.4 to 2000.4. One method type is shown to accurately gauge sublimation using two humidity and wind speed measurement levels. The other “bulk” method type is shown to underestimate condensation, as it assumes surface saturation. General climate models employ bulk methods and, consequently, underestimate deposition. Loss of water vapor by the surface predominates in summer at lower elevations, where bulk methods agree better with two-level methods. Annual net water vapor flux from the two-level method is as great as −87 ±27 mm at 960 m elevation and −74 ±23 mm at equilibrium line altitude in western Greenland. At an undulation trough site, net deposition is observed (+40 mm ±12). At the adjacent crest site 6 km away and at 50 m higher elevation, net sublimation predominates. At high-elevation sites, the annual water vapor flux is positive, up to +32 ±9 mm at the North Greenland Ice core Project (NGRIP) and +6 ±2 mm at Summit. Sublimation is mapped using trend surface fits to calculated sublimation in terms of elevation and latitude. The resulting ice sheet total sublimation is −0.62 ± 0.25 × 1014 kg yr−1 for the two-level profile method and −1.2 ± 0.65 × 1014 kg yr−1 for the one-level method, indicating 12{\%} or 23{\%} precipitation loss, respectively.

In polar regions, climate dynamics are controlled by both radiative and non-radiative interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets and land surfaces. Precisely quantifying polar feedbacks is required for a process-oriented evaluation of climate models, a clear understanding of the processes responsible for polar climate changes, and a reduction in uncertainty associated with model projections. This quantification can be performed using a simple and consistent approach that is valid for a wide range of feedbacks, offering the opportunity for more systematic feedback analyses and a better understanding of polar climate changes.},

abstract = {Because the Arctic climate is particularly sensitive to cloud-radiative interactions, climate models must represent Arctic clouds realistically in order to capture the variations and feedbacks in high-latitude climate. Observations of clouds and radiative fluxes for the North Slope of Alaska are available from the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program. Reanalysis models also calculate cloud and radiative variables. In this study, ARM measurements and North American Regional Reanalysis output for four midseason months are used to show that boundary layer clouds are not only the most common type of cloud observed on the North Slope but they are also a major cause for error by the reanalysis. Near-surface clouds are associated with large overestimates of the cloud fraction during the cold season and large underestimates during the warm season. These results were synthesized with other data to produce a comprehensive picture of synoptic conditions that are commonly present when the reanalysis fails to simulate the cloud fraction. When errors in the simulated cloud fraction are largest during the cold season, anomalously high pressure is observed north of the Bering Strait, with the departure being largest in magnitude and most widespread spatially in January. Large undersimulations in the summer are associated with a +9 hPa deviation from climatology over the Arctic Ocean, a configuration that favors onshore flow from the northeast and east. More generally, large undersimulations in the summer clouds at Barrow are almost exclusively associated with onshore flow.},

abstract = {This paper presents the status of land-surface temperature (LST) standard products retrieved from Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Based on estimates of the channel-dependence error and noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) and the calibration accuracy of MODIS thermal-infrared data, the impact of instrument performance on the accuracy of LST is discussed. A double-screen scheme based on the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST algorithm and the aggregated 1-km LST retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm, and the difference between daytime and nighttime LSTs, is proposed to remove the LSTs contaminated with cloud effects. The accuracy of daily MODIS LST product at 1-km resolution, which was produced by the generalized split-window algorithm, was validated in 11 clear-sky cases with in situ measurement data collected in field campaigns in 2000 and 2001. The MODIS LST accuracy is better than 1 K in the range from 263 to 300 K over Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, Mono Lake, Bridgeport grassland, and a rice field in Chico, CA, and Walker Lake, Nevada (NV), in the atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.0 cm. It is difficult to validate the daytime LST product over land sites rather than lakes with ground-based measurements alone because of the high spatial variations in the in situ LST measurement data, which was verified by the daytime data of the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) over a grassland in Bridgeport, CA, on October 6, 2000. In six cases over a silt playa in Railroad Valley, NV, the 1-km MODIS LSTs are a few Kelvin degrees lower than the in situ measured LSTs because the surface emissivities inferred from land cover types in the split-window LST method are often overestimated in semi-arid and arid regions. After a correction with the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST method and the LST aggregated from 1-km LSTs retrieved by the split-window method, the MODIS LSTs agree with in situ measured LSTs within 1 K in the range 263-322 K for the six cases in Railroad Valley and one case of snowcover in Bridgeport, CA, leading a recommendation for use of the 5-km LST product retrieved by the day/night LST method in bare and sparse vegetated areas.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. While the radiative influence of clouds on Arctic sea ice is known, the influence of sea ice cover on Arctic clouds is challenging to detect, separate from atmospheric circulation, and attribute to human activities. Providing observational constraints on the two-way relationship between sea ice cover and Arctic clouds is important for predicting the rate of future sea ice loss. Here we use 8 years of CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) spaceborne lidar observations from 2008 to 2015 to analyze Arctic cloud profiles over sea ice and over open water. Using a novel surface mask to restrict our analysis to where sea ice concentration varies, we isolate the influence of sea ice cover on Arctic Ocean clouds. The study focuses on clouds containing liquid water because liquid-containing clouds are the most important cloud type for radiative fluxes and therefore for sea ice melt and growth. Summer is the only season with no observed cloud response to sea ice cover variability: liquid cloud profiles are nearly identical over sea ice and over open water. These results suggest that shortwave summer cloud feedbacks do not slow long-term summer sea ice loss. In contrast, more liquid clouds are observed over open water than over sea ice in the winter, spring, and fall in the 8 year mean and in each individual year. Observed fall sea ice loss cannot be explained by natural variability alone, which suggests that observed increases in fall Arctic cloud cover over newly open water are linked to human activities.},

We implement a slightly different derivation method, investigate the composition of the regimes, and then proceed to examine several aspects of CR radiative appearance with the aid of various radiative flux datasets. Our results clearly show the CRs are radiatively distinct in terms of shortwave, longwave and their combined (total) cloud radiative effect. We show that we can clearly distinguish regimes based on whether they radiatively cool or warm the atmosphere, and thanks to radiative heating profiles to discern the vertical distribution of cooling and warming. Terra and Aqua comparisons provide information about the degree to which morning and afternoon occurrences of regimes affect the symmetry of CR radiative contribution. We examine how the radiative discrepancies among multiple irradiance datasets suffering from imperfect spatiotemporal matching depend on CR, and whether they are therefore related to the complexity of cloud structure, its interpretation by different observational systems, and its subsequent representation in radiative transfer calculations.},

TRMM radar data show a significant midweek increase in the echo-top heights reached by afternoon storms. Weekly variations in model-reanalysis wind patterns over the region are consistent with changes in convection implied by the satellite data. Weekly variations in rain gauge averages are also consistent with the satellite estimates, though possibly smaller in amplitude. A midweek decrease of rainfall over the nearby Atlantic is also seen. EPA measurements of surface particulate concentrations show a midweek peak over much of the U.S. These observations are consistent with the theory that anthropogenic air pollution suppresses cloud-drop coalescence and early rainout during the growth of thunderstorms over land, allowing more water to be carried above the 0C isotherm, where freezing yields additional latent heat, invigorating the storms and producing large ice hydrometeors. The enhanced convection induces regional convergence, uplifting and an overall increase of rainfall. Compensating downward air motion suppresses convection over the adjacent ocean areas. Pre-TRMM-era data suggest that the weekly cycle only became strong enough to be detectable beginning in the 1980{\&}{\#}039;s. Rain-gauge data also suggest that a weekly cycle may have been detectable in the 1940{\&}{\#}039;s, but with peak rainfall on Sunday or Monday, possibly explained by the difference in composition of aerosol pollution at that time. This {\&}ldquo;weekend effect{\&}rdquo; may thus offer climate researchers an opportunity to study the regional climate-scale impact of aerosols on storm development and monsoon-like circulation.},

abstract = {The Community Climate System Model, version 4 has revisions across all components. For sea ice, the most notable improvements are the incorporation of a new shortwave radiative transfer scheme and the capabilities that this enables. This scheme uses inherent optical properties to define scattering and absorption characteristics of snow, ice, and included shortwave absorbers and explicitly allows for melt ponds and aerosols. The deposition and cycling of aerosols in sea ice is now included, and a new parameterization derives ponded water from the surface meltwater flux. Taken together, this provides a more sophisticated, accurate, and complete treatment of sea ice radiative transfer. In preindustrial CO2 simulations, the radiative impact of ponds and aerosols on Arctic sea ice is 1.1 W m(-2) annually, with aerosols accounting for up to 8 W m-2 of enhanced June shortwave absorption in the Barents and Kara Seas and with ponds accounting for over 10 W m(-2) in shelf regions in July. In double CO2 (2XCO(2)) simulations with the same aerosol deposition, ponds have a larger effect, whereas aerosol effects are reduced, thereby modifying the surface albedo feedback. Although the direct forcing is modest, because aerosols and ponds influence the albedo, the response is amplified. In simulations with no ponds or aerosols in sea ice, the Arctic ice is over 1 m thicker and retains more summer ice cover. Diagnosis of a twentieth-century simulation indicates an increased radiative forcing from aerosols and melt ponds, which could play a role in twentieth-century Arctic sea ice reductions. In contrast, ponds and aerosol deposition have little effect on Antarctic sea ice for all climates considered.},

abstract = {The impacts of increased open water in the Beaufort Sea were investigated for a summer Arctic storm in 2008 using a coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model. The storm originated in northern Siberia and slowly moved into the Beaufort Sea along the ice edge in late July. The maximum wind associated with the storm occurred when it was located over the open water near the Beaufort Sea coast, after it had moved over the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The coupled model system is shown to simulate the storm track, intensity, maximum wind speed and the ice cover well. The model simulations suggest that the lack of ice cover in the Beaufort Sea during the 2008 storm results in increased local surface wind and surface air temperature, compared to enhanced ice cover extents such as occurred in past decades. In addition, due to this increase of open water, the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes into the atmosphere are significantly increased. However, there were no significant impacts on the storm track. The expanded open water and the loss of the sea ice results in increases in the surface air temperature by as much as 8 degrees C. Although the atmospheric warming mostly occurs in the boundary layer, there is increased atmospheric boundary turbulence and downward kinetic energy transport that reach to mid-levels of the troposphere and beyond. These changes result in enhanced surface winds, by as much as similar to 4 m/s during the 2008 storm, compared to higher ice concentration conditions (typical of past decades). The dominant sea surface temperature response to the storm occurs over open water; storm-generated mixing in the upper ocean results in sea surface cooling of up to 2 degrees C along the southern Beaufort Sea coastal waters. The Ekman divergence associated with the storm caused a decrease in the fresh water content in the central Beaufort Sea by about 11 cm.},

abstract = {In most examples of inference and prediction, the expression of uncertainty about unknown quantities y on the basis of known quantities x is based on a model M that formalizes assumptions about how x and y are related. M will typically have two parts: structural assumptions S, such as the form of the link function and the choice of error distribution in a generalized linear model, and parameters $\theta$ whose meaning is specific to a given choice of S. It is common in statistical theory and practice to acknowledge parametric uncertainty about $\theta$ given a particular assumed structure S; it is less common to acknowledge structural uncertainty about S itself. A widely used approach involves enlisting the aid of x to specify a plausible single `best' choice S* for S, and then proceeding as if S* were known to be correct. In general this approach fails to assess and propagate structural uncertainty fully and may lead to miscalibrated uncertainty assessments about y given x. When miscalibration occurs it will often result in understatement of inferential or predictive uncertainty about y, leading to inaccurate scientific summaries and overconfident decisions that do not incorporate sufficient hedging against uncertainty. In this paper I discuss a Bayesian approach to solving this problem that has long been available in principle but is only now becoming routinely feasible, by virtue of recent computational advances, and examine its implementation in examples that involve forecasting the price of oil and estimating the chance of catastrophic failure of the US space shuttle.},

In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal variability in SEB across tundra, snow and ice. During the snow-free period, the main energy sink for ice sites is surface melt. For tundra, energy is used for sensible and latent heat flux and soil heat flux leading to permafrost thaw. Longer snow-free period increases melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and glaciers and may promote tundra permafrost thaw. During winter, clouds have a warming effect across surface types whereas during summer clouds have a cooling effect over tundra and a warming effect over ice, reflecting the spatial variation in albedo. The complex interactions between factors affecting SEB across surface types remain a challenge for understanding current and future conditions. Extended monitoring activities coupled with modelling efforts are essential for assessing the impact of warming in the Arctic.},

The model output is compared with meteorological and energy balance observations from 15 Greenland Climate Network automatic weather stations. The model reproduces the monthly average surface climate parameters, to a large extent within model and observational uncertainty. However, certain systematic model biases were identified, caused in particular by inaccurate GTOPO30 elevation data over Greenland, 180 m lower on average, with errors as large as −840 m over 50-km grid cells. The resulting warm biases enhance a negative albedo bias, which in turn leads to positive net shortwave radiation biases. Surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are overestimated, apparently due to model warm bias and 100{\%} greater than observed wind speeds.

abstract = {In this study, the representation of marine boundary layer clouds is investigated in the ECMWF model using observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) mobile facility deployment to Graciosa Island in the North Atlantic. Systematic errors in the occurrence of clouds, liquid water path, precipitation, and surface radiation are assessed in the operational model for a 19-month-long period. Boundary layer clouds were the most frequently observed cloud type but were underestimated by 10{\%} in the model. Systematic but partially compensating surface radiation errors exist and can be linked to opposing cloud cover and liquid water path errors in broken (shallow cumulus) and overcast (stratocumulus) low-cloud regimes, consistent with previously reported results from the continental ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. Occurrence of precipitation is overestimated by a factor of 1.5 at cloud base and by a factor of 2 at the surface, suggesting deficiencies in both the warm-rain formation and subcloud evaporation parameterizations. A single-column version of the ECMWF model is used to test combined changes to the parameterizations of boundary layer, autoconversion/accretion, and rain evaporation processes at Graciosa. Low-cloud occurrence, liquid water path, radiation biases, and precipitation occurrence are all significantly improved when compared to the ARM observations. Initial results from the modified parameterizations in the full model show improvement in the global top-of-the-atmosphere shortwave radiation, suggesting the reduced errors in the comparison at Graciosa are more widely applicable to boundary layer cloud around the globe.

abstract = {Estimates of the indirect aerosol effect in GCMs assume that either cloud liquid water path is constant (Twomey effect) or increases with increased droplet number concentration (drizzle-suppression or Albrecht effect). On the other hand, if cloud thermodynamics and dynamics are considered, cloud liquid water path may also decrease with increasing droplet number concentration, which has been predicted by model calculations and observed in ship track and urban influence studies. This study examines the different changes of cloud liquid water path associated with changes of cloud droplet number concentration. Satellite data (January, April, July, and October 1987) are used to determine the cloud liquid water sensitivity, defined as the ratio of changes of liquid water path and changes of column droplet number concentration. The results of a global survey for water clouds (cloud-top temperature {\textgreater}273 K, optical thickness 1 less than or equal to tau {\textless} 15) reveal all three behaviors of cloud liquid water path with aerosol changes: increasing, approximately constant, or decreasing as cloud column number concentration increases. The authors find that 1) in about one-third of the cases, predominantly in warmer locations or seasons, the cloud liquid water sensitivity is negative, and the regional and seasonal variations of the negative liquid water sensitivity are consistent with other observations; 2) in about one-third of the cases, a minus one-third (-1/3) power-law relation between effective droplet radius and column number concentration is found, consistent with a nearly constant cloud water path; and 3) in the remaining one-third of the cases, the cloud liquid water sensitivity is positive. These results support the suggestion that it is possible for an increase of cloud droplet number concentration to both reduce cloud droplet size and enhance evaporation just below cloud base, which decouples the cloud from the boundary layer in warmer locations, decreasing water supply from surface and reducing cloud liquid water. Results of this study also suggest that the current evaluations of the negative aerosol indirect forcing by GCMs, which are based on either the Twomey or Albrecht effects, may be overestimated in magnitude.},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopes are used extensively to examine physiological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes related to ecosystem, regional, and global carbon cycles and provide information at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Much is known about the processes that regulate the carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)C) of leaf, plant, and ecosystem carbon pools and of photosynthetic and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fluxes. In this review, systematic patterns and mechanisms underlying variation in delta(13)C of plant and ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes are described. We examine the hypothesis that the delta(13)C of leaf biomass can be used as a reference point for other carbon pools and fluxes, which differ from the leaf in delta(13)C in a systematic fashion. Plant organs are typically enriched in (13)C relative to leaves, and most ecosystem pools and respiratory fluxes are enriched relative to sun leaves of dominant plants, with the notable exception of root respiration. Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of leaves and leaf respiration suggests that growth respiration has the potential to contribute substantially to the observed offset between the delta(13)C values of ecosystem respiration and the bulk leaf. We discuss the implications of systematic variations in delta(13)C of ecosystem pools and CO(2) fluxes for studies of carbon cycling within ecosystems, as well as for studies that use the delta(13)C of atmospheric CO(2) to diagnose changes in the terrestrial biosphere over annual to millennial time scales.},

Ocean heat uptake caused by sea ice retreat is isolated by running the model with the sea ice albedo reduced artificially alone. This integration has a climate response with strong ocean heat uptake in the Southern Ocean and modest ocean heat uptake in the subsurface Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean warming results from enhanced ocean heat transport from the northern North Atlantic. At the time of CO2 doubling, about 1/3 of the heat transport anomaly results from advection of anomalously warm water and 2/3 results from strengthened inflow. At the same time the overturning circulation is strengthened in the northern North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Win...},

abstract = {Variations in the extreme percentiles of empirical hourly PM2.5 concentration distributions from a unique high-density network of 20 stations within New York City are statistically analyzed. Significant diurnal, seasonal and day-of-week variations are noted, with the highest concentrations typically found between 7:00 and 9:00{\&}{\#}xa0;a.m., during summer, and on weekdays. The lowest concentrations are generally found during early morning hours (4:00{\^{a}}6:00{\&}{\#}xa0;a.m.), in winter and on weekends. The amplitudes of these seasonal and diurnal cycles vary with percentile, with less pronounced cycles for the lowest and in some cases highest percentiles. The diurnal and day-of-week patterns suggest that although anthropogenic factors may be primarily responsible for the observed diurnal cycle, meteorological conditions also have some influence.

There is little spatial variation in concentration across the city. Highly significant between-station correlations are obtained for all seasons. However, lower correlation is found in winter. Meteorologically, the highest PM2.5 concentrations occur with moderate southwesterly winds and high temperatures and humidity during summer. These conditions are related to the westward expansion of the Bermuda high-pressure system. Calm winds are conducive to the highest winter particulate concentrations. Relatively strong northerly winds are typically associated with the lowest PM2.5 concentrations. It appears that regional-scale processes dominate day-to-day changes in particulate concentrations across the city.},

@article{Trusel2018,
abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is a growing contributor to global sea-level rise 1 , with recent ice mass loss dominated by surface meltwater runoff 2,3. Satellite observations reveal positive trends in GrIS surface melt extent 4 , but melt variability, intensity and runoff remain uncertain before the satellite era. Here we present the first continuous, multi-century and observationally constrained record of GrIS surface melt intensity and runoff, revealing that the magnitude of recent GrIS melting is exceptional over at least the last 350 years. We develop this record through stratigraphic analysis of central west Greenland ice cores, and demonstrate that measurements of refrozen melt layers in percolation zone ice cores can be used to quantifiably, and reproducibly, reconstruct past melt rates. We show significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and spatially extensive correlations between these ice-core-derived melt records and modelled melt rates 5,6 and satellite-derived melt duration 4 across Greenland more broadly, enabling the reconstruction of past ice-sheet-scale surface melt intensity and runoff. We find that the initiation of increases in GrIS melting closely follow the onset of industrial-era Arctic warming in the mid-1800s, but that the magnitude of GrIS melting has only recently emerged beyond the range of natural variability. Owing to a nonlinear response of surface melting to increasing summer air temperatures, continued atmospheric warming will lead to rapid increases in GrIS runoff and sea-level contributions. Melting across higher elevations of the GrIS results in liquid water infiltration, percolation, and either refreezing or storage within the porous firn layer. Such processes reduce ice-sheet surface albedo, increase firn temperatures 7 , and may generate impermeable ice layers that exacerbate ice-sheet runoff 8 , the proportion of surface melt leaving the ice sheet. Runoff across the margins of the GrIS is presently the leading source of mass loss from the ice sheet 2,3,6 , and has been implicated in the centennial-scale slowdown of the overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean 9. GrIS surface melting in 2012 was more expansive than at any time over the 40 years since we started measuring melt using satellites (in 1978) 4. Proposed mechanisms driving melt in 2012 include contributions from anomalous radiative 10-12 and non-radiative 13 energy fluxes, and anticyclonic atmospheric circulation favouring advection of warm, dry air and clear sky conditions 14. An ice core record from Summit Station (Fig. 1) demonstrated the exceptional nature of 2012 melt at high elevation (about 3,200 m), revealing 15 that it last occurred at this site in 1889. At lower elevations, where melt occurs more frequently and at greater rates, there exist only limited ice-core-derived reconstructions of melt variability 16-18 and no quantifiable ice-core-based reconstructions of melt intensity or runoff. Furthermore, large discrepancies among reanalysis products over Greenland before the mid-twentieth century 6,19 limit their utility over longer timescales. Consequently, the true anomaly of recent melt intensity and runoff, and the longer-term evolution of these processes in response to climate forcing, remain poorly constrained. Here we analyse refrozen melt layer stratigraphy in ice cores from central west Greenland (CWG) drilled between 2003 and 2015 to quantify annual melting over the last several centuries (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 1a). Significant co-variability between records from two cores separated by about 40 km in the western GrIS accumulation area (cores GC and D5; Fig. 1) indicates that regional melt, percolation and refreezing are well preserved and represented in these multi-century cores (Fig. 2 inset; Methods). We combine records from cores GC and D5 with a shallower core (core GW; Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1b) to create a single 339-year stacked CWG record (Methods). CWG reveals frequent, but generally low-magnitude, melting during the last three centuries, with approximately 13-year periodicity and a marked departure from low-melt conditions over the last two decades (Fig. 2). We develop a complementary 364-year melt record using a fourth core (core NU) recovered from an ice cap on Nuussuaq Peninsula (Fig. 1) in 2015. The NU core record contains a greater overall magnitude of melt than the CWG combined core record owing to its lower elevation and coastal location (Extended Data Table 1), similar 13-16-year oscillations , and a distinct departure from baseline conditions in recent decades (Fig. 2). Common periodicities in the CWG and NU melt records suggest the influence of multiple known climate modes on melt variability (Extended Data Fig. 2; Methods). In all cores, there is also a clear pattern towards more frequent, thicker (and thus more intense) melt layers towards the present day (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Our results show a pronounced 250{\%} to 575{\%} increase in melt intensity over the last 20 years, relative to a pre-industrial baseline period (eighteenth century) for cores NU and CWG, respectively (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the most recent decade contained in the cores (2004-2013) experienced a more sustained and greater magnitude of melt than any other 10-year period in the ice-core records. For GrIS cores, 2012 melt is unambiguously the strongest melt season on record. Both NU and CWG annual ice-core-derived melt records significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) correlate with one another over their 339 years of overlap, and both also with summer air temperatures from the Ilulissat region (Extended Data Table 2; Methods), relationships that improve after applying a 5-year moving average, probably reflecting the noise inherent to melt records owing to variability in meltwater percolation and refreezing 8,16. These empirically derived results revealing coherence between independent melt and temperature records emphasize broad-scale GrIS melt forcing, and suggest that summer warming (see Fig. 2) is an important component of the observed regional melt intensification. GrIS ice cores provide a valuable point-scale view of melt history within the percolation zone, but records of past melt variability within the GrIS saturation and bare ice zones, where melt is more directly tied to mass loss and runoff, have remained elusive. To assess whether our ice-core-derived melt records also serve as quantitative archives of past regional-scale melt variability and intensity, we examine correlations between the CWG stack and recent modelled and observed melt parameters across the entire GrIS (Fig. 3; Methods).

abstract = {Carbonyl sulfide (COS) concentrations were measured in surface seawater samples and the overlying marine boundary layer of the Pacific Ocean by using gas chromatography (GC) and electron capture sulfur detection (ECD-S). A wide latitudinal range was covered (55 degrees N-70 degrees S) on two cruises 9 months apart. COS saturation ratios (SRs) in seawater were found to be less than 1 (undersaturated) across wide regions of the open ocean, especially in the subtropical gyres and wintertime subpolar waters. SRs were highest in coastal/shelf regions and in spring/summertime temperate waters. Extensive undersaturation is attributed to a low COS photoproduction potential of the water, limited sunlight, and/or a rapid hydrolysis rate constant. Decreasing COS concentrations during diurnal cycles in tropical waters were fitted to first-order exponentials, with resulting decay times agreeing with calculated hydrolysis lifetimes to within 15{\%}. Air-sea fluxes of COS from the open ocean were calculated by using two different expressions for the transfer velocity and averaged into six latitude bands and three seasons. On the basis of these data we report a global open ocean sea-air flux of -0.032 (-0.010 to -0.054) Tg COS/yr, which is much lower than and of different sign from the current global estimate (0.14-0.58 Tg COS/yr). Atmospheric COS mixing ratios averaged 470 pptv on the first cruise and 442 pptv on the second cruise, with much of the difference possibly a result of a seasonal decrease in the northern hemisphere COS mixing ratio of up to 10{\%}.},

DARF calculations for base-state climatological cloud and aerosol properties over ocean and land are performed, and then repeated after perturbing individual aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical depth, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, scale height, and anthropogenic fraction) from their base values, keeping all other parameters fixed. The total DARF uncertainty from all aerosol parameters combined is 0.5–1.0 W m22, a factor of 2–4 greater than the value cited in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC's) Fourth Assessment Report. Most of the total DARF uncertainty in this analysis is associatedwith single-scattering albedo uncertainty.Owing to the greater sensitivity to single-scattering albedo in cloudy columns,DARF uncertainty in all-sky conditions is greater than in clear-sky conditions, even though the global mean clear-sky DARF is more than twice as large as the all-sky DARF.},

Strengths and weaknesses of these products are identified, and their biases are found to vary by season and glaciological regime. MERRA2 reanalysis overall performs best with mean absolute error less than 2 °C in all months. Ice sheet-average annual mean SAT from different datasets are highly correlated in recent decades, but their 1901–2000 trends differ even in sign. Compared with the MERRA2 climatology combined with gridded SAT analysis anomalies, thirty-one earth system model historical runs from the CMIP5 archive reach ∼ 5 °C for the 1901–2000 average bias and have opposite trends for a number of sub-periods.},

Although Asia is a large source of these compounds, until now a long-term study of their emission patterns has not been carried out. Here we analyze 16 months of RSC data measured at a polluted rural/coastal site in the greater Pearl River Delta (PRD) of southern China. A total of 188 canister air samples were collected from August 2001 to December 2002. The OCS and CS(2) mixing ratios within these samples were higher in autumn/winter and lower in summer due to the influence of Asian monsoon circulations. Comparatively low DMS values observed in this coastal region suggest a relatively low biological productivity during summer months. The springtime OCS levels in the study region (574 +/- 40 pptv) were 25{\%} higher than those on other East Asia coasts such Japan, whereas the springtime CS(2) and DMS mixing ratios in the PRD (47 +/- 38 pptv and 22 +/- 5 pptv, respectively) were 3-30 times lower than elevated values that have been measured elsewhere in East Asia (Japan and Korea) at this time of year. Poor correlations were found among the three RSCs in the whole group of 188 samples, suggesting their complex and variable sources in the region. By means of backward Lagrangian particle release simulations, air samples originating from the inner PRO, urban Hong Kong and South China Sea were identified. The mean mixing ratio of OCS in the inner PRD was significantly higher than that in Hong Kong urban air and South China Sea marine air (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas no statistical differences were found for DMS and CS(2) among the three regions (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Using a linear regression method based on correlations with the urban tracer CO, the estimated OCS emission in inner PRD (49.6 +/- 4.7 Gg yr(-1)) was much higher than that in Hong Kong (0.32 +/- 0.05 Gg yr(-1)), whereas the estimated CS(2) and DMS emissions in the study region accounted for a very few percentage of the total CS(2) and DMS emission in China. These findings lay the foundation for better understanding sulfur chemistry in the greater PRD region of southern China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AbstractThe large decrease in Arctic sea ice in recent years has triggered a strong interest in Arctic sea ice predictions on seasonal-to-decadal time scales. Hence, it is important to understand physical processes that provide enhanced predictability beyond persistence of sea ice anomalies. This study analyzes the natural variability of Arctic sea ice from an energy budget perspective, using 15 climate models from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5), and compares these results to reanalysis data. The authors quantify the persistence of sea ice anomalies and the cross correlation with the surface and top-of-atmosphere energy budget components. The Arctic energy balance components primarily indicate the important role of the seasonal ice?albedo feedback, through which sea ice anomalies in the melt season reemerge in the growth season. This is a robust anomaly reemergence mechanism among all 15 climate models. The role of the ocean lies mainly in storing heat content anomalies in spring and releasing them in autumn. Ocean heat flux variations play only a minor role. Confirming a previous (observational) study, the authors demonstrate that there is no direct atmospheric response of clouds to spring sea ice anomalies, but a delayed response is evident in autumn. Hence, there is no cloud?ice feedback in late spring and summer, but there is a cloud?ice feedback in autumn, which strengthens the ice?albedo feedback. Anomalies in insolation are positively correlated with sea ice variability. This is primarily a result of reduced multiple reflection of insolation due to an albedo decrease. This effect counteracts the ice-albedo effect up to 50{\%}. ERA-Interim and Ocean Reanalysis System 4 (ORAS4) confirm the main findings from the climate models.},

This implies that, if seasonal cloud amounts were not changing, surface warming would be even greater than that observed.

Precipitation is one critical diagnostic that is not only sensitive to the observing system and model physics, but also reflects the general circulation. Climate records of observed precipitation through a merged satellite and gauge dataset provide a reference for comparison, though not without their own uncertainty. In this study, five reanalyses precipitation fields are compared with two observed data products to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the reanalyses. Taylor diagrams show the skill of the reanalyses relative to the reference dataset. While there is a general sense that the reanalyses precipitation data are improving in recent systems, it is not always the case. In some ocean regions, NCEP–NCAR reanalysis spatial patterns are closer to observed precipitation than NCEP–Department of Energy. The 40-yr ECMWF reanalysis (ERA-40) produces rea- sonable comparisons over Northern Hemisphere continents, but less so in the tropical oceans. On the other hand, the most recent reanalysis, the Japanese 25-yr reanalysis (JRA-25), shows good comparisons in both the Northern Hemisphere continents and the tropical oceans but contains distinct variation according to the available observing systems. The statistics and methods used are also tested on short experiments from a data assimilation system proposed to perform a satellite-era reanalysis.},

Southern Hemispheric (SH) concentrations appear to have been almost constant at 482 +/- 13 ppt over this period, apart from a slight rise in the earliest part of the record. Northern Hemispheric (NH) concentrations also showed relatively little variation with a mean of 525 +/- 17 ppt. Over the last ten years, however, NH concentrations appear to have declined by about 8 +/- 5{\%}. Such a decline might be due to decreased carbon disulfide (CS2) emissions by the viscose-rayon industry.

abstract = {Abstract The uncertainty in optical depths retrieved from satellite measurements of visible wavelength radiance at the top of the atmosphere is quantified. Techniques are briefly reviewed for the estimation of optical depth from measurements of radiance, and it is noted that these estimates are always more uncertain at greater optical depths and larger solar zenith angles. The lack of radiometric calibration for visible wavelength imagers on operational satellites dominates the uncertainty retrievals of optical depth. This is true for both single-pixel retrievals and for statistics calculated from a population of individual retrievals. For individual estimates or small samples, sensor discretization (especially for the VAS instrument) can also be significant, but the sensitivity of the retrieval to the specification of the model atmosphere is less important. The relative uncertainty in calibration affects the accuracy with which optical depth distributions measured by different sensors may be quantitative...},

abstract = {Plant photosynthesis tends to increase with irradiance. However, recent theoretical and observational studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is also more efficient under diffuse light conditions. Changes in cloud cover or atmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic emissions, alter both the total photosynthetically active radiation reaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation that is diffuse, with uncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. Here we estimate the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on the land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of variations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We estimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the 'global dimming' period, enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately one-quarter between 1960 and 1999. However, under a climate mitigation scenario for the twenty-first century in which sulphate aerosols decline before atmospheric CO(2) is stabilized, this 'diffuse-radiation' fertilization effect declines rapidly to near zero by the end of the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {The most practical way to get spatially broad and continuous measurements of the surface temperature in the data-sparse cryosphere is by satellite remote sensing. The uncertainties in satellite-derived LSTs must be understood to develop internally-consistent decade-scale land surface temperature (LST) records needed for climate studies. In this work we assess satellite-derived "clear-sky" LST products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and LSTs derived from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) over snow and ice on Greenland. When possible, we compare satellite-derived LSTs with in-situ air temperature observations from Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) automatic weather stations (AWS). We find that MODIS, ASTER and ETM+ provide reliable and consistent LSTs under clear-sky conditions and relatively-flat terrain over snow and ice targets over a range of temperatures from -40 to 0 degrees C. The satellite-derived LSTs agree within a relative RMS uncertainty of -0.5 degrees C. The good agreement among the LSTs derived from the various satellite instruments is especially notable since different spectral channels and different retrieval algorithms are used to calculate LST from the raw satellite data. The AWS record in-situ data at a "point" while the satellite instruments record data over an area varying in size from: 57 x 57 m (ETM+), 90 x 90 m (ASTER), or to 1 x 1 km (MODIS). Surface topography and other factors contribute to variability of LST within a pixel, thus the AWS measurements may not be representative of the LST of the pixel. Without more information on the local spatial patterns of LST, the AWS LST cannot be considered valid ground truth for the satellite measurements, with RMS uncertainty similar to 2 degrees C. Despite the relatively large AWS-derived uncertainty, we find LST data are characterized by high accuracy but have uncertain absolute precision. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The$\backslash$nrecord includes liquid-phase and liquid dominant mixed-phase Arctic$\backslash$nstratus macrophysical, microphysical, and radiative properties, as well$\backslash$nas surface radiation budget and cloud radiative forcing. The$\backslash$nmacrophysical properties consist of cloud fractions, cloud-base/top$\backslash$nheights and temperatures, and cloud thickness derived from a$\backslash$nground-based radar and lidar pair, and rawinsonde sounding. The$\backslash$nmicrophysical properties include cloud liquid water path and content,$\backslash$nand cloud-droplet effective radius and number concentration obtained$\backslash$nfrom microwave radiometer brightness temperature measurements, and the$\backslash$nnew cloud parameterization. The radiative properties contain cloud$\backslash$noptical depth, effective solar transmission, and$\backslash$nsurface/cloud/top-of-atmosphere albedos derived from the new cloud$\backslash$nparameterization and standard Epply precision spectral pyranometers. The$\backslash$nshortwave, longwave, and net cloud radiative forcings at the surface are$\backslash$ninferred from measurements by standard Epply precision spectral$\backslash$npyranometers and pyrgeometers. There are approximately 300 h and more$\backslash$nthan 3600 samples (5-min resolution) of single-layer and overcast$\backslash$nlow-level stratus during the study period. The 10-day averaged total and$\backslash$nlow-level cloud (Z(top) {\textless} 3 km) fractions are 0.87 and 0.55, and$\backslash$nlow-level cloud-base and -top heights are around 0.4 and 0.8 km. The$\backslash$ncloud-droplet effective radii and number concentrations in the spring$\backslash$nare similar to midlatitude continental stratus cloud microphysical$\backslash$nproperties, and in the summer they are similar to midlatitude marine$\backslash$nstratus clouds. The total cloud fractions in this study show good$\backslash$nagreement with the satellite and surface results compiled from data$\backslash$ncollected during the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology$\backslash$nProject (ISCCP) Regional Experiment (FIRE) Arctic Cloud Experiment (ACE)$\backslash$nand the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA)$\backslash$n({\&}SIM;77{\&}DEG;N, 165{\&}DEG;W) field experiments in 1998. The cloud$\backslash$nmicrophysics derived from this study are similar, in general, to those$\backslash$ncollected in past field programs, although these comparisons are based$\backslash$non data collected at different locations and years. At the ARM NSA site,$\backslash$nthe summer cooling period is much longer (2-3 months vs 1-2 weeks), and$\backslash$nthe summer cooling magnitude is much larger (-100 W m(-2) vs -5 W m(-2))$\backslash$nthan at the SHEBA ship under the conditions of all skies at the SHEBA$\backslash$nand overcast low-level stratus clouds at the NSA site.},

Here we investigate this assumption using multi-model data. We consider the correlation between inter-model similarities in the spatial pattern for the present-day climate and future climate change for surface air temperature, precipitation and sea level pressure on global and zonal domains in the seasonal time scale. We further extend previous work by devising a bootstrap method to estimate the statistical significance of all correlations, which have previously not been estimated. Most of the correlation coefficients for precipitation were significant, but moderate or low in the absolute value. Many of those for the other variables were not significant. Also, we discuss the magnitude of the inter-model similarity used in this work.},

However, the cloud's adiabaticity, the ratio between the liquid water path and its theoretical maximum, is at least as important and determines how the liquid water path sensitivity to temperature varies with temperature. At temperatures below 0° C, the adiabaticity increases with warming, and the data support mechanism (b). At warmer temperatures, the adiabaticity decreases with warming, overwhelming mechanism (a) and resulting in the liquid water path decreasing with warming. This adiabaticity decrease arises primarily because of mechanism (d), and to a lesser degree because of mechanism (e). No evidence is found supporting mechanism (c).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO[x]) are not only precursors of ozone (O[3]) but also of secondary PM, it is useful to know whether the variations by day of week in these precursors are also evident in PM data. Concentrations of PM{\&}{\#}8804;10 {\&}{\#}956;m (PM[10]) and {\&}{\#}8804;2.5 {\&}{\#}956;m in aerodynamic diameter (PM[2.5]) were analyzed. PM concentrations exhibit a general weekly pattern, with the maximum occurring late in the workweek and the minimum occurring on weekends (especially Sunday); however, this pattern does not prevail at all sites and areas. PM nitrate (NO[3]) data from Size Selective Inlet (SSI) samplers in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) tend to be somewhat lower on weekends compared with weekdays. During 1988-1991, the weekend average was lower than the weekday average at 8 of 13 locations, with an average decrease of 1{\%}. During 1997-2000, the weekend average was lower than the weekday average at 10 of 13 locations, with an average decrease of 6{\%}. The weekend averages are generally lower than weekday averages for sulfates, organic carbon, and elemental carbon. Because heavy-duty trucks typically represent a major source of elemental carbon, the weekend decrease in heavy-duty truck traffic may also result in a decrease in ambient elemental carbon concentrations.},

abstract = {Plausible estimates for the effect of soot on snow and ice albedos (1.5{\%} in the Arctic and 3{\%} in Northern Hemisphere land areas) yield a climate forcing of +0.3 W/m(2) in the Northern Hemisphere. The "efficacy" of this forcing is approximately 2, i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO(2) in altering global surface air temperature. This indirect soot forcing may have contributed to global warming of the past century, including the trend toward early springs in the Northern Hemisphere, thinning Arctic sea ice, and melting land ice and permafrost. If, as we suggest, melting ice and sea level rise define the level of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, then reducing soot emissions, thus restoring snow albedos to pristine high values, would have the double benefit of reducing global warming and raising the global temperature level at which dangerous anthropogenic interference occurs. However, soot contributions to climate change do not alter the conclusion that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been the main cause of recent global warming and will be the predominant climate forcing in the future.},

abstract = {Spatially continuous data of environmental variables are often required for environmental sciences and management. However, information for environmental variables is usually collected by point sampling, particularly for the mountainous region and deep ocean area. Thus, methods generating such spatially continuous data by using point samples become essential tools. Spatial interpolation methods (SIMs) are, however, often data-specific or even variable-specific. Many factors affect the predictive performance of the methods and previous studies have shown that their effects are not consistent. Hence it is difficult to select an appropriate method for a given dataset. This review aims to provide guidelines and suggestions regarding application of SIMs to environmental data by comparing the features of the commonly applied methods which fall into three categories, namely: non-geostatistical interpolation methods, geostatistical interpolation methods and combined methods. Factors affecting the performance, including sampling design, sample spatial distribution, data quality, correlation between primary and secondary variables, and interaction among factors, are discussed. A total of 25 commonly applied methods are then classified based on their features to provide an overview of the relationships among them. These features are quantified and then clustered to show similarities among these 25 methods. An easy to use decision tree for selecting an appropriate method from these 25 methods is developed based on data availability, data nature, expected estimation, and features of the method. Finally, a list of software packages for spatial interpolation is provided. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

We analyzed a 2-year time series of meteorological data (January 2011–December 2012) from three automatic weather stations on Laohugou glacier No. 12, western Qilian Mountains, China. Air temperature, humidity and incoming radiation were significantly correlated between the three sites, while wind speed and direction were not. In this work, we focus on the effects of clouds on other meteorological parameters and on glacier melt. On an average, {\~{}}18{\%} of top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation was attenuated by the clear-sky atmosphere, and clouds attenuated a further 12{\%}. Most of the time the monthly average increases in net longwave radiation caused by clouds were larger than decreases in net shortwave radiation but there was a tendency to lose energy during the daytime when melting was most intense. Air temperature and wind speed related to turbulent heat flux were found to suppress glacier melt during cloudy periods, while increased water vapor pressure during cloudy days could enhance glacier melt by reducing energy loss by latent heat. From these results, we have increased the physical understanding of the significance of cloud effects on continental glaciers.},

abstract = {Using surface measurements of maximum and minimum temperatures from the Global Daily Climatological Network data set, we find evidence of a weekly cycle in diurnal temperature range (DTR) for many stations in the United States, Mexico, Japan, and China. The "weekend effect," which we define as the average DTR for Saturday through Monday minus the average DTR for Wednesday through Friday, can be as large as 0.5 K, similar to the magnitude of observed long-term trends in DTR. This weekend effect has a distinct large-scale pattern that has changed only slightly over time, but its sign is not the same in all locations. The station procedures and the statistical robustness of both the individual station data and the patterns of DTR differences are thoroughly examined. We conclude that the weekend effect is a real short time scale and large spatial scale geophysical phenomenon, which is necessarily human in origin. We thus provide strong evidence of an anthropogenic link to DTR, an important climate indicator. Several possible anthropogenic mechanisms are discussed; we speculate that aerosol-cloud interactions are the most likely cause of this weekend effect, but we do not rule out others.},

abstract = {We describe the climatology from a meteorological dataset acquired from automatic weather station observations done in the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet be-tween 2001 and 2007. Stations were placed in three regions below the polar circle: on the southern tip of the ice sheet, on a calving glacier in the Nuuk fjord, and on 5 the south-eastern ice margin near Tasiilaq. The yearly cycles in temperature, relative humidity and wind speed reveal the largest variability in wintertime, causing annual val-ues to depend largely on winter values. Adding to wintertime variability are extremely strong and cold katabatic wind events in the southeast (" piteraqs "). During summer no pronounced daily cycle in near-surface atmospheric parameters is recorded in the 10 three regions, in spite of a large cycle in solar radiation, dominantly regulating surface melt. Net ablation is largest at the southernmost station due to low surface albedo, and can be up to six metres per year, but is highly sensitive to the timing of the start of the ice ablation season. Illustrative of this is that similar ablation amounts are found in the Nuuk fjord region where little or no snow accumulates in winter.},

abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils--including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost--than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

Emphasis is placed on the impact of clouds on the incoming and outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the two-way interaction of clouds with other variables of the climate system, i.e., the cloud/climate feedback problem, as revealed by climate model simulations. Investigations aimed at determining the overall effects of clouds on the climate system (climate forcing) show that clouds have a net cooling effect. Two estimates of the global annual average effect of clouds on the net flux at the top of the atmosphere, based on recent satellite observations, show wide discrepancies. The sign of cloud feedback is found to be positive when the spatial distribution of clouds is allowed to vary in response to climate change. It is concluded that clouds may have a strong influence on climate change, but the magnitude of this influence is unknown.},

In addition, spatially and temporally collocated multichannel Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are utilized for the detection of two blowing snow events in sunlight. Blowing snow frequency as high as 70{\%} is found to occur in some regions of Antarctica during winter. The spatial distribution of blowing snow closely follows the katabatic wind pattern with the exception of an area in East Antarctica that encompasses the megadune region, where the most persistent and largest area of blowing snow occurs. Layer thickness ranges from the minimum detectable (30 m) to about 1000 m with an average depth of 120 m for all blowing snow events. The layer optical depth estimated from the lidar data ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 with an average of 0.20. A very large, organized blowing snow "storm" is tracked over 3 days and is estimated to transport a mass of 6.3 x 10(3) kg m(-1) d(-1) which is comparable to surface-based measurements of mass transport during blowing snow events. Results from the application of the retrieval technique to ICESat data are also presented with a demonstration of the large multiple scattering-induced elevation error that blowing snow layers can cause.},

abstract = {In January 2016, the Arctic experienced an extremely anomalous warming event after an extraordinary increase in air temperature at the end of 2015. During this event, a strong intrusion of warm and moist air and an increase in downward longwave radiation, as well as a loss of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, were observed. Observational analyses revealed that the abrupt warming was triggered by the entry of a strong Atlantic windstorm into the Arctic in late December 2015, which brought enormous moist and warm air masses to the Arctic. Although the storm terminated at the eastern coast of Greenland in late December, it was followed by a prolonged blocking period in early 2016 that sustained the extreme Arctic warming. Numerical experiments indicate that the warming effect of sea ice loss and associated upward turbulent heat fluxes are relatively minor in this event. This result suggests the importance of the synoptically driven warm and moist air intrusion into the Arctic as a primary contributing factor of this extreme Arctic warming event. The Arctic has been warming in recent decades in an amplified manner and this warming is accompanied by an unprecedented reduction of sea ice and high-latitude snow cover, which creates a positive feedback loop 1. The influence of Arctic warming, however, is not confined to the Arctic region. Recent studies have provided firm evidence of the substantial remote influence of the warm Arctic. In particular, the below-normal sea ice condition over the Atlantic Arctic sector, such as the Barents and Kara seas, is known to be linked to the Eurasian continental cooling in recent consecutive cold winters 2-7. Despite the importance of the Arctic state for the adjacent mid-latitudes, the major cause of Arctic warming remains a controversial issue. Several important factors of Arctic warming have been suggested, including the following: 1) surface reflectivity of snow and ice 8 , 2) oceanic heat loss by surface turbulent heat fluxes 9 , 3) incoming longwave radiation emitted by water vapor and clouds 10,11 , 4) surface thermal inversion 12 , 5) atmospheric lapse-rate 13 , and 6) poleward atmospheric energy transport by moisture intrusion 14-17. These local and remote factors are strongly coupled and should collectively contribute to Arctic warming. The warming factors interplay with the multi-scale internal variability from synoptic-scale to low-frequency. Either a single storm event or a series of events associated with low-frequency variability, such as blocking flows and atmospheric teleconnection patterns 18,19 , can stir the adjacent ocean through surface turbulent processes and bring warm and humid air from lower latitudes to higher latitudes. This occurrence weakens the surface temperature inversion of the Arctic, reduces the thermodynamic stability by changes in the lapse rate, and increases the incoming longwave radiation by moisture and clouds. Therefore, multiple processes of Arctic warming can be investigated by analyzing storms that enter the Arctic. In the winter season of 2015-16, an extraordinary increase in the Arctic surface air temperature (SAT) was observed after an extreme Atlantic windstorm entered the Arctic Circle in late December 2015. This storm, which was named 'Frank' by the U.K. Met Office, recorded a minimum central pressure of 928 hPa on 30 December 2015 20. Maximum Arctic-mean (north of 65°N) SAT anomalies as high as 7° to 8 °C were recorded on 1-2 January after the storm underwent cyclolysis along the eastern coast of Greenland. The anomalous warm temperature was},

abstract = {Abstract During the last few years, the feasibility of deriving surface radiation budget (SRB) components from satellite observations has been demonstrated and a better understanding of the need for SRB information in climate research was formulated. Much attention has been given to the scales at which such information is needed and to the accuracies required at different spatial and temporal scales. Recently, global acts of satellite observations became available, allowing implementation of satellite models for SRB on a global scale, and international frameworks were established for validating such models. To respond to these developments, we modified and expanded an early version of a physical model to derive surface solar irradiance from satellite observations. The model is based on radiative transfer theory, and can produce both direct and diffuse spectral components in the 0.2–4.0-$\mu$m interval. Attention is given to the absorption and scattering processes in the atmosphere and the interaction of radia...},

abstract = {A 13.94-m-long sediment core, collected from a medium-sized lake in the Qilian Mountains (NE Tibetan Plateau, China), was analysed palynologically at 81 horizons. The interpretation of indicator taxa yielded various vertical shifts of the vegetation belts. These palaeovegetation results have been checked with lake surface pollen spectra from 8 lakes representing different altitudinal vegetation belts. Our main findings are the following: A short period of the late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (around ∼46,000 yr ago) was characterized by interglacial temperature conditions with a tree line above its present-day altitude. During the LGM, the vicinity of the lake was not covered by ice but by sparse alpine vegetation and alpine deserts, indicating that the climate was colder by ∼4–7°C than today. Markedly higher temperatures were inferred from higher arboreal pollen frequencies between ∼13,000 and ∼7,000 yr ago with a Holocene temperature optimum and a maximal Picea–Betula mixed-forest expansion between ∼9,000 and ∼7000 yr ago, when temperatures exceeded the present-day conditions by at least 1–2°C. Alpine steppes and meadows and sub-alpine shrub vegetation dominated around the lake since the middle Holocene, suggesting that vegetation and climate conditions were exceptionally stable in comparison to previous periods.},

@article{Stephens2012a,
abstract = {Climate change is governed by changes to the global energy balance. At the top of the atmosphere, this balance is monitored globally by satellite sensors that provide measurements of energy flowing to and from Earth. By contrast, observations at the surface are limited mostly to land areas. As a result, the global balance of energy fluxes within the atmosphere or at Earth's surface cannot be derived directly from measured fluxes, and is therefore uncertain. This lack of precise knowledge of surface energy fluxes profoundly affects our ability to understand how Earth's climate responds to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. In light of compilations of up-to-date surface and satellite data, the surface energy balance needs to be revised. Specifically, the longwave radiation received at the surface is estimated to be significantly larger, by between 10 and 17 Wm−2, than earlier model-based estimates. Moreover, the latest satellite observations of global precipitation indicate that more precipitation is generated than previously thought. This additional precipitation is sustained by more energy leaving the surface by evaporation — that is, in the form of latent heat flux — and thereby offsets much of the increase in longwave flux to the surface.},

The forcing of all the models by observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice from a 10-yr period (1979–1988) permits comparative evaluations of the model biases as well as the models' simulations of the interannual variations contained in the observational data. The models capture the latitudinal and seasonal variability of surface air temperatures in the Arctic, although a cold bias of −3.3°C (std dev = 3.4°C) is apparent over northern Eurasia during spring, especially in the models that do not include vegetative masking of the high-albedo snow. The 19-model mean bias over northern North America is less than 2°C in all seasons. Over the Arctic Ocean, the spring temperatures generally have a warm bias that averages 3.0 (std dev = 2.9°C), although the bias is smaller in the models in which the prescribed albedo of sea ice is ...},

This ice loss is best viewed as a combination of strong natural variability in the coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere system and a growing radiative forcing associated with rising concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the latter supported by evidence of qualitative consistency between observed trends and those simulated by climate models over the same period. Although the large scatter between individual model simulations leads to much uncertainty as to when a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean might be realized, this transition to a new arctic state may be rapid once the ice thins to a more vulnerable state. Loss of the ice cover is expected to affect the Arctic's freshwater system and surface energy budget and could be manifested in middle latitudes as altered patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation.},

Analysis of six Greenland shallow firn cores from the dry snow region confirms that the most recent prior widespread melt occurred in 1889. A firn core from the center of the ice sheet demonstrated that exceptionally warm temperatures combined with black carbon sediments from Northern Hemisphere forest fires reduced albedo below a critical threshold in the dry snow region, and caused the melting events in both 1889 and 2012. We use these data to project the frequency of widespread melt into the year 2100. Since Arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires are both expected to rise with climate change, our results suggest that widespread melt events on the Greenland Ice Sheet may begin to occur almost annually by the end of century. These events are likely to alter the surface mass balance of the ice sheet, leaving the surface susceptible to further melting.},

abstract = {Intense human activity can impact weather and climate in many ways. One possible important consequence is the weekly cycle (so-called weekend effect) in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The weekend effect is defined as the average DTR for Saturday through Monday minus the average DTR for Wednesday through Friday. In the present study, the weekend effect in the DTR over east China combined with station observations of maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, and total solar irradiance for the period 1955{\&}{\#}8211;2000 was analyzed. Results show that the weekend effect in the DTR has the opposite signal between winter (December, January, and February) and summer (June, July, and August). Wintertime DTR tends to have a positive weekend effect (i.e., larger DTR in weekend days compared to weekdays), in association with increased maximum temperature and total irradiance but decreased relative humidity. While summertime DTR displays a much stronger and significantly negative weekend effect (i.e., smaller DTR in weekend days), in association with decreased maximum temperature and total solar irradiance but increased relative humidity and a greater number of rainy days. This study indicates that the DTR difference between weekend and weekdays is predominantly related to weekly changes in the maximum temperature. The weekend effect in the DTR and maximum temperature is also found in the Reanalysis 2 data. The weekend effect in winter is supported by an analogous holiday (Spring Festival) effect. Since the late 1970s, the weekend effect has been enhanced in both winter and summer, concurrent with rapid development and enhanced human activity in China. The direct and indirect effects of human-related aerosols on radiation, cloud, precipitation, and so on, might play an important role in generating the opposite signal in the weekend effect for different seasons. During a dry winter, the reduction of aerosol concentrations may overwhelmingly impact on the DTR through a direct effect, i.e., by increasing total solar irradiance near the surface and raising the daytime temperature and maximum temperature and lowering relative humidity. By contrast, in summer the indirect effect of aerosols, i.e., reduction in precipitation efficiency caused by more numerous and smaller cloud droplets, would largely be responsible for the increased numbers of rainy days, the reduction of the total solar irradiance, and the lowering of the maximum temperature and DTR.},

abstract = {Atmospheric methane (CH(4)) increased through much of the twentieth century, but this trend gradually weakened until a stable state was temporarily reached around the turn of the millennium, after which levels increased once more. The reasons for the slowdown are incompletely understood, with past work identifying changes in fossil fuel, wetland and agricultural sources and hydroxyl (OH) sinks as important causal factors. Here we show that the late-twentieth-century changes in the CH(4) growth rates are best explained by reduced microbial sources in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results, based on synchronous time series of atmospheric CH(4) mixing and (13)C/(12)C ratios and a two-box atmospheric model, indicate that the evolution of the mixing ratio requires no significant change in Southern Hemisphere sources between 1984 and 2005. Observed changes in the interhemispheric difference of (13)C effectively exclude reduced fossil fuel emissions as the primary cause of the slowdown. The (13)C observations are consistent with long-term reductions in agricultural emissions or another microbial source within the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately half (51 ± 18{\%}) of the decrease in Northern Hemisphere CH(4) emissions can be explained by reduced emissions from rice agriculture in Asia over the past three decades associated with increases in fertilizer application and reductions in water use.},

abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at a dramatic rate in recent years, raising political concern worldwide due to the possible impact on global sea level rise and climate dynamics (Luthcke et al. 2006; Rignot {\&} Kanagaratnam 2006; Velicogna {\&} Wahr 2006; IPCC 2007; Shepherd {\&} Wingham 2007). The Arctic region as a whole is warming up much more rapidly than the globe at large (ACIA 2005) and it is desirable to quantify these changes in order to provide the decision-makers with a firm knowledge base. To cover this need, the Danish Ministry of Climate and Energy has now launched a new Programme for Monitoring of the Green land Ice Sheet (PROMICE), designed and operated by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) in collaboration with the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark and Asiaq (Greenland Survey). The aim of the programme is to quantify the annual mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet, track changes in the extent of local glaciers and ice caps, and track changes in the position of the ice-sheet margin.},

abstract = {This paper compares daytime cloud fraction derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), an imager on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing System Aqua and Terra platforms, to observations from a suite of surface-based instrumentation located at the Department of Energy's atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM) program North Slope of Alaska (NSA) Clouds and Radiation Testbed site. In this systematic comparison of satellite-to-surface measurements, 3650 cases are analyzed from February through September 2001. The surface instruments used in these comparisons include the Vaisala Ceilometer (VCEIL), the Micropulse Lidar (MPL), the Active Remote Sensing of Clouds (ARSCL) composite laser-derived data product, the Whole-Sky Imager (WSI), and the Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer (NIP). In terms of the active sensors, VCEIL cloud cover results compare to within ±20{\%} of MODIS results 77{\%} of the time. As expected, VCEIL is found to be insensitive to optically thin high-level clouds. MPL results are consistent with MODIS in 83{\%} of the cases; however, the MPL preliminary.cbh variable reports spurious clouds in clear-sky conditions. The ARSCL composite laser-derived data product agrees with MODIS in 81{\%} of the cases, improving upon high cloud detection of the VCEIL, while eliminating the spurious clear-sky cloud detections in the MPL preliminary.cbh variable. For the passive WSI, cloud cover agrees with the MODIS cloud fraction in 74{\%} of the cases, with the difference primarily caused by the insensitivity of the WSI to thin clouds. Detailed analysis of individual cases shows that the MODIS cloud mask generally detects more thin cirrus than the surface-based instruments, but it sometimes fails to detect low-level cumulus and fog over the ARM NSA site.},

abstract = {Vascular grafts can be twisted inadvertently during implantation. If twisted excessively, they may kink and obstruct flow. In this study, in vitro experiments were performed to identify the mechanical factors that determine graft kinking. These included graft material, graft length, graft diameter, graft wall thickness, perfusion pressure, and flow rate. Six-millimeter-diameter saphenous veins were obtained from humans at autopsy. Six-millimeter standard-wall and 6-mm thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts also were obtained. Both fixed-length and stretchable PTFE grafts were examined. Grafts 15, 30, 50, and 70 cm in length were evaluated. Finally, PTFE grafts 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mm in diameter were studied to determine the effect of diameter. The vessels were mounted horizontally in vitro and were perfused with saline at 50, 100, or 150 mmHg pressure at low (49 mL/min), medium (105 mL/min), and high (239 mL/min) flow rates. Each graft was twisted 90 degrees, then subjected to perfusion for 15 sec. Pressure and flow were interrupted, and an additional 90 degrees twist was imposed for another 15 sec. This sequence was repeated until a visible kink developed. We conclude from our results that, when constructing a bypass, particular care should be taken with vein, short grafts, thin-wall grafts, and large-diameter grafts, as these are especially susceptible to kinking.},

To address critical gaps in the understanding of these systems, a new suite of cloud- and atmosphere-observing instruments has been installed on the central GIS as part of the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project. During the first 20 months in operation, this complementary suite of active and passive ground-based sensors and radiosondes has provided new and unique perspectives on important cloud–atmosphere properties. High atop the GIS, the atmosphere is extremely dry and cold with strong near-surface static stability predominating throughout the year, particularly in winter. This low-level thermodynamic structure, coupled with frequent moisture inversions, conveys the importance of advection for local cloud and precipitation formation.

abstract = {Possible changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) provide a key source of uncertainty regarding future climate change. Maps of temperature trends over the twentieth century show a conspicuous region of cooling in the northern Atlantic. Here we present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that this cooling may be due to a reduction in the AMOC over the twentieth century and particularly after 1970. Since 1990 the AMOC seems to have partly recovered. This time evolution is consistently suggested by an AMOC index based on sea surface temperatures, by the hemispheric temperature difference, by coral-based proxies and by oceanic measurements. We discuss a possible contribution of the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet to the slowdown. Using a multi-proxy temperature reconstruction for the AMOC index suggests that the AMOC weakness after 1975 is an unprecedented event in the past millennium (p{\textgreater}0.99). Further melting of Greenland in the coming decades could contribute to further weakening of the AMOC.},

At regional and global scales, characteristics of soils and snow cover can best be mapped and analyzed using satellite-based sensors that acquire both spectral and angular reflectance information. Advances in surface reflectance models over the past decade now provide improved interpretation of remote sensing imagery over snow. However, advances have been slower in remote sensing of soil properties and a number of key issues remain. This article begins with an overview of the similarities and differences between particulate media modeling approaches for soil and snow. We review common modeling methods: radiative transfer approximations, numerical solutions, and geometrical optics. Model inversion and validation experiments are summarized and research priorities are discussed.},

abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

abstract = {Abstract. Surface melting is a major driver of Greenland's mass loss. Yet, the mechanisms that trigger melt are still insufficiently understood because seasonally-based studies blend processes initiating melt with positive feedbacks. Here, we focus on the triggers of melt by examining the synoptic atmospheric conditions associated with 313 rapid melt increases, detected in a satellite-derived melt extent product, equally distributed throughout the year over the period 1979{\&}ndash;2012. By combining reanalysis and weather station data, we show that melt is initiated by a cyclone-driven, southerly flow of warm, moist air, which gives rise to large-scale precipitation. A decomposition of the synoptic atmospheric variability over Greenland suggests that the identified, melt-triggering weather pattern accounts for {\~{}} 40 {\%} of the net precipitation but increases in the frequency, duration and areal extent of the initiated melting have shifted the line between mass gain and mass loss as more melt and rainwater run off or accumulate in the snowpack. Using a regional climate model, we estimate that the initiated melting more than doubled over the investigated period, amounting to {\~{}} 28 {\%} of the overall surface melt and revealing that, despite the involved mass gain, year-round precipitation events are participating in the ice sheet's decline.},

3, melt more freq in winter; melt-extent larger in summer

In winter (DJF), the katabatic pressure$\backslash$ngradient force (PGF) dominates the momentum budget of the atmospheric$\backslash$nboundary layer (ABL) over the ice sheet. Over the western slopes$\backslash$nof the ice sheet, the large-scale PGF acts in the same direction$\backslash$nas the katabatic PGF, resulting in a strong southerly jet of up to$\backslash$n12 m s{\&}{\#}8722;1. In winter, the accumulation of cold air over the$\backslash$nsea ice along the northeast coast leads to a thermally induced northerly$\backslash$nflow. This circulation facilitates southward sea ice transport in$\backslash$nthis area and is enhanced by the large-scale circulation. Along the$\backslash$nwest coast, a similar west-east temperature gradient also forces$\backslash$na northerly flow. In the summer months, sea ice is absent, and thermal$\backslash$nwind forcing is largely reduced over the ocean. Summer insolation$\backslash$nalso reduces katabatic forcing; the large-scale forcing dominates$\backslash$nthe ABL momentum budget over the ice sheet. Heating of the ABL over$\backslash$nthe snow-free tundra induces thermal contrasts with the ice sheet$\backslash$nand ocean, forcing barrier winds in the coastal regions. Throughout$\backslash$nthe year, strong surface layer winds along the southeast coast of$\backslash$nGreenland are forced by the large-scale PGF.},

@article{Garrett2013,
abstract = {This paper describes a method for using interferometer measurements of downwelling thermal radiation to retrieve the properties of single-layer clouds. Cloud phase is determined from ratios of thermal emission in three "micro-windows" at 862.5 cm(-1), 935.8 cm(-1), and 988.4cm(-1) where absorption by water vapour is particularly small. Cloud microphysical and optical properties are retrieved from thermal emission in the first two of these micro-windows, constrained by the transmission through clouds of primarily stratospheric ozone emission at 1040 cm(-1). Assuming a cloud does not approximate a blackbody, the estimated 95 {\%} confidence retrieval errors in effective radius r(e), visible optical depth tau, number concentration N, and water path WP are, respectively, 10{\%}, 20{\%}, 38 {\%} (55 {\%} for ice crystals), and 16{\%}. Applied to data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement programme (ARM) North Slope of Alaska Adjacent Arctic Ocean (NSA-AAO) site near Barrow, Alaska, retrievals show general agreement with both ground-based microwave radiometer measurements of liquid water path and a method that uses combined shortwave and microwave measurements to retrieve r(e), tau and N. Compared to other retrieval methods, advantages of this technique include its ability to characterise thin clouds year round, that water vapour is not a primary source of retrieval error, and that the retrievals of microphysical properties are only weakly sensitive to retrieved cloud phase. The primary limitation is the inapplicability to thicker clouds that radiate as blackbodies and that it relies on a fairly comprehensive suite of ground based measurements.},

abstract = {A large degree of uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs) can be attributed to the representation of clouds and how they interact with incoming solar and outgoing longwave radiation. In this study, the simulated total cloud fraction (CF), cloud water path (CWP), top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiation budgets and cloud radiative forcings (CRFs) from 28 CMIP5 AMIP models are evaluated and compared with multiple satellite observations from CERES, MODIS, ISCCP, CloudSat, and CALIPSO. The multimodel ensemble mean CF (57.6 {\%}) is, on average, underestimated by nearly 8 {\%} (between 65°N/S) when compared to CERES–MODIS (CM) and ISCCP results while an even larger negative bias (17.1 {\%}) exists compared to the CloudSat/CALIPSO results. CWP bias is similar in comparison to the CF results, with a negative bias of 16.1 gm−2 compared to CM. The model simulated and CERES EBAF observed TOA reflected SW and OLR fluxes on average differ by 1.8 and −0.9 Wm−2, respectively. The averaged SW, LW, and net CRFs from CERES EBAF are −50.1, 27.6, and −22.5 Wm−2, respectively, indicating a net cooling effect of clouds on the TOA radiation budget. The differences in SW and LW CRFs between observations and the multimodel ensemble means are only −1.3 and −1.6 Wm−2, respectively, resulting in a larger net cooling effect of 2.9 Wm−2 in the model simulations. A further investigation of cloud properties and CRFs reveals that the GCM biases in atmospheric upwelling (15°S–15°N) regimes are much less than in their downwelling (15°–45°N/S) counterparts over the oceans. Sensitivity studies have shown that the magnitude of SW cloud radiative cooling increases significantly with increasing CF at similar rates ({\~{}}−1.25 Wm−2 {\%}−1) in both regimes. The LW cloud radiative warming increases with increasing CF but is regime dependent, suggested by the different slopes over the upwelling and downwelling regimes (0.81 and 0.22 Wm−2 {\%}−1, respectively). Through a comprehensive error analysis, we found that CF is a primary modulator of warming (or cooling) in the atmosphere. The comparisons and statistical results from this study may provide helpful insight for improving GCM simulations of clouds and TOA radiation budgets in future versions of CMIP.},

abstract = {Cloud Fraction (CF) is the dominant modulator of radiative fluxes. In this study, we evaluate CF simulated in the IPCC AR4 GCMs against ARM long-term ground-based measurements, with a focus on the vertical structure, total amount of cloud and its effect on cloud shortwave transmissivity. Comparisons are performed for three climate regimes as represented by the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites: Southern Great Plains (SGP), Manus, Papua New Guinea and North Slope of Alaska (NSA). Our intercomparisons of three independent measurements of CF or sky-cover reveal that the relative differences are usually less than 10{\%} (5{\%}) for multi-year monthly (annual) mean values, while daily differences are quite significant. The total sky imager (TSI) produces smaller total cloud fraction (TCF) compared to a radar/lidar dataset for highly cloudy days (CF {\textgreater} 0.8), but produces a larger TCF value than the radar/lidar for less cloudy conditions (CF {\textless} 0.3). The compensating errors in lower and higher CF days result in small biases of TCF between the vertically pointing radar/lidar dataset and the hemispheric TSI measurements as multi-year data is averaged. The unique radar/lidar CF measurements enable us to evaluate seasonal variation of cloud vertical structures in the GCMs. Both inter-model deviation and model bias against observation are investigated in this study. Another unique aspect of this study is that we use simultaneous measurements of CF and surface radiative fluxes to diagnose potential discrepancies among the GCMs in representing other cloud optical properties than TCF. The results show that the model-observation and inter-model deviations have similar magnitudes for the TCF and the normalized cloud effect, and these deviations are larger than those in surface downward solar radiation and cloud transmissivity. This implies that other dimensions of cloud in addition to cloud amount, such as cloud optical thickness and/or cloud height, have a similar magnitude of disparity as TCF within the GCMs, and suggests that the better agreement among GCMs in solar radiative fluxes could be a result of compensating effects from errors in cloud vertical structure, overlap assumption, cloud optical depth and/or cloud fraction. The internal variability of CF simulated in ensemble runs with the same model is minimal. Similar deviation patterns between inter-model and model-measurement comparisons suggest that the climate models tend to generate larger biases against observations for those variables with larger inter-model deviation. The GCM performance in simulating the probability distribution, transmissivity and vertical profiles of cloud are comprehensively evaluated over the three ARM sites. The GCMs perform better at SGP than at the other two sites in simulating the seasonal variation and probability distribution of TCF. However, the models remarkably underpredict the TCF at SGP and cloud transmissivity is less susceptible to the change of TCF than observed. In the tropics, most of the GCMs tend to underpredict CF and fail to capture the seasonal variation of CF at middle and low levels. The high-level CF is much larger in the GCMs than the observations and the inter-model variability of CF also reaches a maximum at high levels in the tropics, indicating discrepancies in the representation of ice cloud associated with convection in the models. While the GCMs generally capture the maximum CF in the boundary layer and vertical variability, the inter-model deviation is largest near the surface over the Arctic.},

abstract = {Soil samples from arable land were investigated for their exchange of carbonyl sulfide (CPS) with the atmosphere under controlled conditions using dynamic cuvettes in a climate chamber. The investigated sail type acted as a significant sink for the trace gas COS. Atmospheric COS mixing ratios, temperature, and soil water content were found to be the physicochemical parameters controlling the uptake. Emission was never observed under conditions representative Of a natural environment. The observed compensation point (i.e., an ambient concentration where the consumption and production balance each other and the net flux is zero) for the uptake was about 53 parts per trillion. Uptake rates ranged between 1.5 and 10.3 pmol m(-2) s(-1). The consumption of COS by the soil sample depended on the physiological activity of the microorganisms in the soil, as indicated by a clear optimum temperature and by a drastic inhibition in the presence of the enzyme inhibitor 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazole-2-sulfonamide (EZ), a specific inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase.},

abstract = {The DYRESM-CAEDYM model is a valuable tool for simulating water temperature for biochemical studies in aquatic ecosystem. The model requires inputs of surface short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation or total cloud cover fraction (TC). Long-wave radiation is often not measured directly so a method to determine TC from commonly measured short-wave solar irradiance (E0) and theoretical short-wave solar irradiance under a clear sky (Ec) has broad application. A more than 17-year (15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009) hourly solar irradiance data set was used to estimate the peak solar irradiance for each ordinal date over one year, which was assumed to be representative of solar irradiance in the absence of cloud. Comparison between these daily observed values and the modelled clear-sky solar radiation over one year was in close agreement (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.995 and root mean squared error, RMSE = 12.54 W m-2). The downloaded hourly cloudiness measurements from 15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009 was used to calculate the daily values for this period and then the calculated daily values over the 17 years were used to calculate the average values for each ordinal date over one year. A regression equation between (1 - E0/Ec) and TC produced a correlation coefficient value of 0.99 (p {\textgreater} 0.01, n = 71). The validation of this cloud cover estimation model was conducted with observed short-wave solar radiation and TC at two sites. Values of TC derived from the model at the Lake Rotorua site gave a reasonable prediction of the observed values (RMSE = 0.10, r = 0.86, p {\textgreater} 0.01, n = 61). The model was also tested at Queenstown (South Island of New Zealand) and it provided satisfactory results compared to the measurements (RMSE = 0.16, r = 0.67, p {\textgreater} 0.01, n = 61). Therefore the model's good performance and broad applicability will contribute to the DYRESM-CAEDYM accuracy of water temperature simulation when long-wave radiation is not available. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {The reliability of the global reanalyses in the polar regions is investigated. The overview stems from an April 2006 Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) workshop on the performance of global reanalyses in high latitudes held at the British Antarctic Survey. Overall, the skill is much higher in the Arctic than the Antarctic, where the reanalyses are only reliable in the summer months prior to the modern satellite era. In the Antarctic, large circulation differences between the reanalyses are found primarily before 1979, when vast quantities of satellite sounding data started to be assimilated. Specifically for ERA-40, this data discontinuity creates a marked jump in Antarctic snow accumulation, especially at high elevations. In the Arctic, the largest differences are related to the reanalyses depiction of clouds and their associated radiation impacts; ERA-40 captures the cloud variability much better than NCEP1 and JRA-25, but the ERA-40 and JRA-25 clouds are too optically thin for shortwave radiation. To further contrast the reanalyses skill, cyclone tracking results are presented. In the Southern Hemisphere, cyclonic activity is markedly different between the reanalyses, where there are few matched cyclones prior to 1979. In comparison, only some of the weaker cyclones are not matched in the Northern Hemisphere from 1958-2001, again indicating the superior skill in this hemisphere. Although this manuscript focuses on deficiencies in the reanalyses, it is important to note that they are a powerful tool for climate studies in both polar regions when used with a recognition of their limitations.},

abstract = {The present and twenty-first century near-sur-face wind climate of Greenland is presented using output from the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2. The modelled wind variability and wind distribution compare favourably to observations from three automatic weather stations in the ablation zone of southwest Green-land. The Weibull shape parameter is used to classify the wind climate. High values (j [ 4) are found in northern Greenland, indicative of uniform winds and a dominant katabatic forcing, while lower values (j $\backslash$ 3) are found over the ocean and southern Greenland, where the synoptic forcing dominates. Very high values of the shape parameter are found over concave topography where confluence strengthens the katabatic circulation, while very low values are found in a narrow band along the coast due to barrier winds. To simulate the future (2081–2098) wind climate RACMO2 was forced with the HadGEM2-ES general cir-culation model using a scenario of mid-range radiative forcing of ?4.5 W m -2 by 2100. For the future simulated climate, the near-surface potential temperature deficit reduces in all seasons in regions where the surface tem-perature is below the freezing point, indicating a reduction in strength of the near-surface temperature inversion layer. This leads to a wind speed reduction over the central ice sheet where katabatic forcing dominates, and a wind speed increase over steep coastal topography due to counteracting effects of thermal and katabatic forcing. Thermally forced winds over the seasonally sea ice covered region of the Greenland Sea are reduced by up to 2.5 m s -1 .},

The model was applied to simulate a 28-day evolution of clouds over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains site during the summer 1997 Intensive Observation Period. The model was forced by the large-scale advective tendencies and surface fluxes derived from the observations. The sensitivity of the results to the domain dimensionality and size, horizontal grid resolution, and parameterization of microphysics has been tested. In addition, the sensitivity to perturbed initial conditions has also been tested using a 20-member ensemble of runs. The model captures rather well the observed temporal evolution of the precipitable water and precipitation rate, although it severely underestimates the shaded cloud fraction possibly because of an inability to account for the lateral advection of clouds over the ARM site. The ensemble runs reveal t...},

These include processes related to the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation (NAO/AO), anticyclonic/cyclonic regimes, changes in the oceanic and atmospheric North Atlantic–Arctic exchange, and changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. After a brief critical review, the influence and interrelation of the above processes in a long climate integration of the Community Climate System Model, version 2 (CCSM2) are examined. The analysis is based on the time series of surface air temperature integrated northward of 70°N, which serves as a useful proxy for general Arctic climate conditions. This gives a large-scale view of the evolution of Arctic climate. It is found that changes in oceanic exchange and heat transport in the Barents Sea dominate in forcing the Arctic surface air temperature variability in CCSM2.

Winter ice thickness in the Community Earth System Model's Large Ensemble compares well against thickness estimates from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System and CryoSat-2, despite some significant regional differences—for example, a high thickness bias in Community Earth System Model's Large Ensemble in the western Arctic. Differences across the available CryoSat-2 thickness products hinder more robust validation efforts. We assess the importance of the negative conductive feedback of sea ice growth (thinner ice grows faster) by regressing October atmosphere/ice/ocean conditions against winter ice growth. Our regressions demonstrate the importance of a strong negative conductive feedback process in our current climate, which increases winter growth for thinner initial ice, but indicate that later in the 21st century this negative feedback is overwhelmed by variations in the fall atmosphere/ocean state.},

Data from 45 bird species were used. Overall, 44{\%} of all records were taken at weekends in contrast to the 28.6{\%} (i.e. two out of seven days) that would be expected if records were evenly spread throughout the week. Whilst there is documented evidence of environmental differences at weekends, particularly in large urban areas, we believe the weekend effect is mostly a consequence of greater recorder effort at weekends. Some birds, likely to be obvious by their behaviour or abundance, had fewer weekend records than the remaining species. The weekend effect, to some extent, differed between locations and between seasons. There was some evidence that, particularly in autumn, the weekend bias may be lessening. If so, this will increase the accuracy of phenological records, making the detection of changes and responses to temperature easier.},

abstract = {The last six years (2007-2012) show a persistent change in early summer Arctic wind patterns relative to previous decades. The persistent pattern, which has been previously recognized as the Arctic Dipole (AD), is characterized by relatively low sea-level pressure over the Siberian Arctic with high pressure over the Beaufort Sea, extending across northern North America and over Greenland. Pressure differences peak in June. In a search for a proximate cause for the newly persistent AD pattern, we note that the composite 700 hPa geopotential height field during June 2007-2012 exhibits a positive anomaly only on the North American side of the Arctic, thus creating the enhanced mean meridional flow across the Arctic. Coupled impacts of the new persistent pattern are increased sea ice loss in summer, long-lived positive temperature anomalies and ice sheet loss in west Greenland, and a possible increase in Arctic-subarctic weather linkages through higher-amplitude upper-level flow. The North American location of increased 700 hPa positive anomalies suggests that a regional atmospheric blocking mechanism is responsible for the presence of the AD pattern, consistent with observations of unprecedented high pressure anomalies over Greenland since 2007.

abstract = {COS uptake by trees, as observed under dark/light changes and under application of the plant hormone abscisic acid, exhibited a strong correlation with the CO2 assimilation rate and the stomatal conductance. As the uptake of COS occurred exclusively through the stomata we compared experimentally derived and re-evaluated deposition velocities (V-d; related to stomatal conductance) for COS and CO2. We show that Vd of COS is generally significantly larger than that of CO2. We therefore introduced this attribute into a new global estimate of COS fluxes into vegetation. The new global estimate of the COS uptake based on available net primary productivity data (NPP) ranges between 0.69-1.40 Tg a(-1). However, as a COS molecule is irreversibly split in contrast to CO2 which is released again by respiration processes, we took into account the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) representing the true CO2 leaf flux the COS uptake has to be related to. Such a GPP based deposition estimate ranged between 1.4-2.8 Tg a(-1) (0.73-1.50 Tg S a(-1)). We believe that in order to obtain accurate global COS sink estimates such a GPP-based estimate corrected by the different deposition velocities of COS and CO2 must be taken into account.},

abstract = {We assess the recent contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea level change. We use the mass budget method, which quantifies ice sheet mass balance (MB) as the difference between surface mass balance (SMB) and solid ice discharge across the grounding line (D). A comparison with independent gravity change observations from GRACE shows good agreement for the overlapping period 2002–2015, giving confidence in the partitioning of recent GrIS mass changes. The estimated 1995 value of D and the 1958–1995 average value of SMB are similar at 411 and 418 Gt yr−1, respectively, suggesting that ice flow in the mid-1990s was well adjusted to the average annual mass input, reminiscent of an ice sheet in approximate balance. Starting in the early to mid-1990s, SMB decreased while D increased, leading to quasi-persistent negative MB. About 60 {\%} of the associated mass loss since 1991 is caused by changes in SMB and the remainder by D. The decrease in SMB is fully driven by an increase in surface melt and subsequent meltwater runoff, which is slightly compensated by a small ( {\textless} 3 {\%}) increase in snowfall. The excess runoff originates from low-lying ( {\textless} 2000 m a.s.l.) parts of the ice sheet; higher up, increased refreezing prevents runoff of meltwater from occurring, at the expense of increased firn temperatures and depleted pore space. With a 1991–2015 average annual mass loss of ∼ 0.47 ± 0.23 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) and a peak contribution of 1.2 mm SLE in 2012, the GrIS has recently become a major source of global mean sea level rise.},

abstract = {Annual minima in Arctic sea-ice extent and volume have been decreasing rapidly since the late 1970s, with substantial interannual variability. Summers with a particularly strong reduction of Arctic sea-ice extent are characterized by anticyclonic circulation anomalies from the surface to the upper troposphere. Here, we investigate the origin of these seasonal circulation anomalies by identifying individual Arctic anticyclones (with a lifetime of typically ten days) and analysing the air mass transport into these systems. We reveal that these episodic upper-level induced Arctic anticyclones are relevant for generating seasonal circulation anomalies. Sea-ice reduction is systematically enhanced during the transient episodes with Arctic anticyclones and the seasonal reduction of sea-ice volume correlates with the area-averaged frequency of Arctic anticyclones poleward of 70° N (correlation coefficient of 0.57). A trajectory analysis shows that these anticyclones result from extratropical cyclones injecting extratropical air masses with low potential vorticity into the Arctic upper troposphere. Our results emphasize the fundamental role of extratropical cyclones and associated diabatic processes in establishing Arctic anticyclones and, in turn, seasonal circulation anomalies, which are of key importance for understanding the variability of summertime Arctic sea-ice melting.},

By covering relatively dark ice with highly reflective fresh snow, these summer snowfalls have the potential to locally reduce melt rates in the ablation zone of the GrIS through the snow-albedo-melt feedback. At larger scales, SMB changes are driven by differences in orographic precipitation following a shift in large-scale circulation, in combination with enhanced moisture to precipitation conversion for warm to moderately cold conditions. A detailed comparison of model output with observations from automatic weather stations, ice cores and ablation stakes shows that the model update generally improves the simulated SMB-elevation gradient as well as the representation of the surface energy balance, although significant biases remain.},

In this study, an area-weighted record of daily temperatures from the United States Historical Climate Network is used to examine the influence of lunar phase variations on the DTR. For the period from 1950 to 1995, a statistically significantly higher DTR occurs near the full moon ({\&}sim;10.23{\&}deg;C) while a lower DTR occurs near the new moon ({\&}sim; 10.13{\&}deg;C). This synodic monthly difference appears to be primarily influenced by warmer maximum daily temperatures occurring near the full moon. This finding allows evaluation of two potential extraterrestrial factors influencing terrestrial temperatures as a function of lunar phase: a) the barycenter effect which is defined as variations in terrestrial and lunar position around their mutual gravitational centroid over the course of synodic month, and b) reflected solar {\&}sol; infrared emission off the lunar surface over the course of a synodic month. While both the barycenter effect and the reflected solar and infrared emission off the lunar surface would influence the minimum temperatures, we suggest that the barycenter effect is likely the dominating extraterrestrial mechanism in explaining lunar phase variations in the diurnal temperature range because its additional influence on daily maximum temperatures.},

abstract = {Climate models robustly predict that the climate of southwestern North America, defined as the area from the western Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean and from the Oregon border to southern Mexico, will dry throughout the current century as a consequence of rising greenhouse gases. This regional drying is part of a general drying of the subtropics and poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones. Through an analysis of 15 coupled climate models it is shown here that the drying is driven by a reduction of winter season precipitation associated with increased moisture divergence by the mean flow and reduced moisture convergence by transient eddies. Due to the presence of large amplitude decadal variations of presumed natural origin, observations to date cannot confirm that this transition to a drier climate is already underway, but it is anticipated that the anthropogenic drying will reach the amplitude of natural decadal variability by midcentury. In addition to this drop in total precipitation, warming is already causing a decline in mountain snow mass and an advance in the timing of spring snow melt disrupting the natural water storage systems that are part of the region's water supply system. Uncertainties in how radiative forcing will impact the tropical Pacific climate system create uncertainties in the amplitude of drying in southwest North America with a La Ni{\~{n}}a-like response creating a worst case scenario of greater drying.},

Both computed and observed albedo of clouds decrease from low to high altitudes. The model with variable cloud optics produces significantly different regional albedos from the same one with fixed cloud optics, especially over the tropics. The cloud droplet size distribution also has a significant impact on the model albedos. The temperature of the tropical upper troposphere is somewhat sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the model cirrus clouds.},

We find that depending on the scene, AIRS Version 5 tropospheric temperature (moisture) retrieval resolution, which is as determined by the full-width at half-maximum of the averaging kernels, ranges between 2.5 km (2.7 km) near the surface and 7.1 km (4.3 km) near the tropopause.},

AbstractThe role of the intermodel spread of cloud–radiation feedback in the uncertainty in the tropical Pacific SST warming (TPSW) pattern under global warming is investigated based on the historical and RCP8.5 runs from 32 models participating in CMIP5. The large intermodel discrepancies in cloud–radiation feedback contribute 24{\%} of the intermodel uncertainty in the TPSW pattern over the central Pacific. The mechanism by which the cloud–radiation feedback influences the TPSW pattern is revealed based on an analysis of the surface heat budget. A relatively weak negative cloud–radiation feedback over the central Pacific cannot suppress the surface warming as greatly as in the multimodel ensemble and thus induces a warm SST deviation over the central Pacific, producing a low-level convergence that suppresses (enhances) the evaporative cooling and zonal cold advection in the western (eastern) Pacific.

abstract = {Reduction of the Arctic sea ice cover can affect the atmospheric circulation and thus impact the climate beyond the Arctic. The atmospheric response may, however, vary with the geographical location of sea ice loss. The atmospheric sensitivity to the location of sea ice loss is studied using a general circulation model in a configuration that allows combination of a prescribed sea ice cover and an active mixed layer ocean. This hybrid setup makes it possible to simulate the isolated impact of sea ice loss and provides a more complete response compared to experiments with fixed sea surface temperatures. Three investigated sea ice scenarios with ice loss in different regions all exhibit substantial near-surface warming, which peaks over the area of ice loss. The maximum warming is found during winter, delayed compared to the maximum sea ice reduction. The wintertime response of the midlatitude atmospheric circulation shows a nonuniform sensitivity to the location of sea ice reduction. While all three scenarios exhibit decreased zonal winds related to high-latitude geopotential height increases, the magnitudes and locations of the anomalies vary between the simulations. Investigation of the North Atlantic Oscillation reveals a high sensitivity to the location of the ice loss. The northern center of action exhibits clear shifts in response to the different sea ice reductions. Sea ice loss in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic cause westward and eastward shifts, respectively.},

abstract = {Ice sheet mass balance estimates have improved substantially in recent years using a variety of techniques, over different time periods, and at various levels of spatial detail. Considerable disparity remains between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates, and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 +/- 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 +/- 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 +/- 1 Gt/yr(2) for Greenland and 14.5 +/- 2 Gt/yr(2) for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 +/- 2 Gt/yr(2). This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 +/- 6 Gt/yr(2)). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century. Citation: Rignot, E., I. Velicogna, M. R. van den Broeke, A. Monaghan, and J.

abstract = {An updated set of time series of derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m's exponent $\alpha$ from a number of Arctic and Antarctic stations was analyzed to determine the long-term variations of these two parameters. The Arctic measurements were performed at Ny-{\AA}lesund (1991–2010), Barrow (1977–2010) and some Siberian sites (1981–1991). The data were integrated with Level 2.0 AERONET sun-photometer measurements recorded at Hornsund, Svalbard, and Barrow for recent years, and at Tiksi for the summer 2010. The Antarctic data-set comprises sun-photometer measurements performed at Mirny (1982–2009), Neumayer (1991–2004), and Terra Nova Bay (1987–2005), and at South Pole (1977–2010). Analyses of daily mean AOD were made in the Arctic by (i) adjusting values to eliminate volcanic effects due to the El Chich{\'{o}}n, Pinatubo, Kasatochi and Sarychev eruptions, and (ii) selecting the summer background aerosol data from those affected by forest fire smoke. Nearly null values of the long-term variation of summer background AOD were obtained at Ny-{\AA}lesund (1991–2010) and at Barrow (1977–2010). No evidence of important variations in AOD was found when comparing the monthly mean values of AOD measured at Tiksi in summer 2010 with those derived from multi-filter actinometer measurements performed in the late 1980s at some Siberian sites. The long-term variations of seasonal mean AOD for Arctic Haze (AH) conditions and AH episode seasonal frequency were also evaluated, finding that these parameters underwent large fluctuations over the 35-year period at Ny-{\AA}lesund and Barrow, without presenting well-defined long-term variations. A characterization of chemical composition, complex refractive index and single scattering albedo of ground-level aerosol polydispersions in summer and winter–spring is also presented, based on results mainly found in the literature. The long-term variation in Antarctic AOD was estimated to be stable, within ±0.10{\%} per year, at the three coastal sites, and nearly null at South Pole, where a weak increase was only recently observed, associated with an appreciable decrease in $\alpha$, plausibly due to the formation of thin stratospheric layers of ageing volcanic particles. The main characteristics of chemical composition, complex refractive index and single scattering albedo of Antarctic aerosols are also presented for coastal particles sampled at Neumayer and Terra Nova Bay, and continental particles at South Pole.},

abstract = {Estimates of impacts from anthropogenic climate change rely on projections from climate models. Uncertainties in those have often been a limiting factor, in particular on local scales. A new generation of more complex models running scenarios for the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) is widely, and perhaps naively, expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections. Here we show that projected global temperature change from the new models is remarkably similar to that from those used in IPCC AR4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. The spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change are also very consistent. Interestingly, the local model spread has not changed much despite substantial model development and a massive increase in computational capacity. Part of this model spread is irreducible owing to internal variability in the climate system, yet there is also uncertainty from model differences that can potentially be eliminated. We argue that defining progress in climate modelling in terms of narrowing uncertainties is too limited. Models improve, representing more processes in greater detail. This implies greater confidence in their projections, but convergence may remain slow. The uncertainties should not stop decisions being made.},

abstract = {Ammassalik in southeast Greenland is known for strong wind events that can reach hurricane intensity and cause severe destruction in the local town. Yet, these winds and their impact on the nearby fjord and shelf region have not been studied in detail. Here, data from two meteorological stations and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) are used to identify and characterize these strong downslope wind events, which are especially pronounced at a major east Greenland fjord, Sermilik Fjord, within Ammassalik. Their local and regional characteristics, their dynamics and their impacts on the regional sea ice cover, and air–sea fluxes are described. Based on a composite of the events it is concluded that wind events last for approximately a day, and seven to eight events occur each winter. Downslope wind events are associated with a deep synoptic-scale cyclone between Iceland and Greenland. During the events, cold dry air is advected down the ice sheet. The downslope flow is accelerated by gravitational acceleration, flow convergence inside the Ammassalik valley, and near the coast by an additional thermal and synoptic-scale pressure gradient acceleration. Wind events are associated with a large buoyancy loss over the Irminger Sea, and it is estimated that they drive one-fifth of the net wintertime loss. Also, the extreme winds drive sea ice out of the fjord and away from the shelf.},

Shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes were measured directly; the former was corrected for problems associated with the cosine response of the instrument. Sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated using the bulk method, and eddy- correlation measurements and the modified Bowen ratio method were used to verify these calculated fluxes.

@article{Hartmann1986,
abstract = {An overview is presented of the uses of top of the atmosphere radiation budget measurements in studies of climate. The net radiative energy flux at the top of the atmosphere must be balanced by local heat storage in the earth-atmosphere column or by horizontal transport in the atmosphere and ocean. Regional variations in the components of the radiation balance are significant and place important constraints on regional and global climate. If suitable time averaging is applied, regional net radiation can be used to infer horizontal transport of energy in the atmosphere and ocean. Estimates of equator-to-pole transport in the atmosphere and ocean based upon currently available top-of-atmosphere radiation budget measurements contain unacceptably large uncertainties associated with uncertainties in the radiation budget measurements themselves. Diurnal and interannual variations in regional radiation balances are large and important but have not yet been properly sampled with broadband instruments. Both have the potential for providing important insights into climate. The role of cloudiness in climate sensitivity remains one of the major uncertainties in quantitative estimates of climate changes associated with particular perturbing influences. Radiation budget data can be used to estimate the effects of actual cloudiness on the top-of-atmosphere heat balance and the dependence of these effects on location and season. The observational studies of the effect of cloudiness on the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere that have been completed to date all suffer from one or more of three fundamental problems. These are that the parameters of the cloudiness are not accurately known, the radiation budget data are not based on measurements whose frequency response is unbiased in relation to the emissions of the sun and the earth, and the diurnal sampling of the measurements is not complete. The uncertainties associated with each of these problems are expected to be reduced as a result of analyses based on data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. In order that quantitative estimates of climate change be as accurate as possible the general circulation models (GCMs) which produce these forecasts must be critically evaluated with observed data. Many of the most important mechanisms for perturbing climate (e.g., CO2, volcanic aerosols, surface albedo changes) and many of the most important feedback processes (e.g., relative humidity feedback, cloud feedback, ice-albedo feedback) directly involve the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere and its relation to surface climate. Since the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere can, in principle, be measured very accurately from space, it is natural that the simulation of top-of-atmosphere energy fluxes by GCMs should be carefully validated against observations. Because of the complexities introduced by clouds, a complete validation of the radiation budget of a GCM is a long and difficult task. A strategy is suggested here in which the clear-sky fluxes of the model are first compared with a clear-sky radiation budget climatology derived from observations. The radiation budgets with clouds included can then also be compared. This procedure should isolate problems not associated with cloudiness and indicate whether, in the grossest sense, the model clouds are correctly influencing the radiation balance. Comparisons between instantaneous synoptic maps of the radiation budget components and numerical forecasts can also be used to diagnose the performance of models.},

In the Colorado River Basin, the early 21st century drought has been the most extreme in over a century of Colorado River flows, and might occur in any given century with probability of only 60{\%}. However, hydrological model runs from downscaled Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate change simulations suggest that the region is likely to become drier and experience more severe droughts than this. In the latter half of the 21st century the models produced considerably greater drought activity, particularly in the Colorado River Basin, as judged from soil moisture anomalies and other hydrological measures. As in the historical record, most of the simulated extreme droughts build up and persist over many years. Durations of depleted soil moisture over the historical record ranged from 4 to 10 years, but in the 21st century simulations, some of the dry events persisted for 12 years or more. Summers during the observed early 21st century drought were remarkably warm, a feature also evident in many simulated droughts of the 21st century. These severe future droughts are aggravated by enhanced, globally warmed temperatures that reduce spring snowpack and late spring and summer soil moisture. As the climate continues to warm and soil moisture deficits accumulate beyond historical levels, the model simulations suggest that sustaining water supplies in parts of the Southwest will be a challenge.},

abstract = {The radiative impact of clouds strongly depends on their partitioning between liquid and ice phases. Until recently, however, it has been challenging to unambiguously discriminate cloud phase in a number of important global regimes. CloudSat and CALIPSO supply vertically resolved measurements necessary to identify clouds composed of both liquid and ice that are not easily detected using conventional passive sensors. The capability of these active sensors to discriminate cloud phase has been incorporated into the fifth generation of CloudSat's 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR algorithm. Comparisons with Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System fluxes at the top of atmosphere reveal that an improved representation of cloud phase leads to better agreement compared to earlier versions of the algorithm. The RMS differences in annual mean outgoing longwave (LW) radiation gridded at 2.5° resolution are 4.9 W m−2, while RMS differences in outgoing shortwave (SW) are slightly larger at 8.9 W m−2 due to the larger diurnal range of solar insolation. This study documents the relative contributions of clouds composed of only liquid, only ice, and a combination of both phases to global and regional radiation budgets. It is found that mixed-phase clouds exert a global net cloud radiative effect of −3.4 W m−2, with contributions of −8.1 W m−2 and 4.7 W m−2 from SW and LW radiation, respectively. When compared with the effects of warm liquid clouds (−11.8 W m−2), ice clouds (3.5 W m−2), and multilayered clouds consisting of distinct liquid and ice layers (−4.6 W m−2), these results reinforce the notion that accurate representation of mixed-phase clouds is essential for quantifying cloud feedbacks in future climate scenarios.},

abstract = {Cloud and thermodynamic characteristics from three Arctic observation sites are investigated to understand the collocation between low-level clouds and temperature inversions. A regime where cloud top was 100-200 m above the inversion base [cloud inside inversion (CII)] was frequently observed at central Arctic Ocean sites, while observations from Barrow, Alaska, indicate that cloud tops were more frequently constrained to inversion base height [cloud capped by inversion (CCI)]. Cloud base and top heights were lower, and temperature inversions were also stronger and deeper, during CII cases. Both cloud regimes were often decoupled from the surface except for CCI over Barrow. In-cloud lapse rates differ and suggest increased cloud-mixing potential for CII cases. Specific humidity inversions were collocated with temperature inversions for more than 60{\%} of the CCI and more than 85{\%} of the CII regimes. Horizontal advection of heat and moisture is hypothesized as an important process controlling thermodynamic structure and efficiency of cloud-generated motions. The portion of CII clouds above the inversion contains cloud radar signatures consistent with cloud droplets. The authors test the longwave radiative impact of cloud liquid above the inversion through hypothetical liquid water distributions. Optically thin CII clouds alter the effective cloud emission temperature and can lead to an increase in surface flux on the order of 1.5 W m(-2) relative to the same cloud but whose top does not extend above the inversion base. The top of atmosphere impact is even larger, increasing outgoing longwave radiation up to 10 W m(-2). These results suggest a potentially significant longwave radiative forcing via simple liquid redistributions for a distinctly dominant cloud regime over sea ice.},

The methodology forms the basis for the AIRS Science Team algorithm, which will be used to analyze AIRS/AMSU/HSB data on the Earth Observing System Aqua platform. The cloud-clearing methodology requires no knowledge of the spectral properties of the clouds. The basic retrieval methodology is general and extracts the maximum information from the radiances, consistent with the channel noise covariance matrix. The retrieval methodology minimizes the dependence of the solution on the first-guess field and the first-guess error characteristics. Results are shown for AIRS Science Team simulation studies with multiple cloud formations. These simulation studies imply that clear column radiances can be reconstructed under partial cloud cover with an accuracy comparable to single spot channel noise in the temperature and water vapor sounding regions; temperature soundings can be produced under partial cloud cover with RMS errors on the order of, or better than, 1 K in 1-km-thick layers from the surface to 700 mb, 1-km layers from 700-300 mb, 3-km layers from 300-30 mb, and 5-km layers from 30-1 mb; and moisture profiles can be obtained with an accuracy better than 20{\%} absolute errors in 1-km layers from the surface to nearly 200 mb.},

abstract = {A version of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) has been developed for use in polar climates. The model known as "Polar WRF" is tested for land areas with a western Arctic grid that has 25-km resolution. This work serves as preparation for the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis of the years 2000-10. The model is based upon WRF version 3.0.1.1, with improvements to the Noah land surface model and snow/ice treatment. Simulations consist of a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC, with the initial 24 h taken as spinup for atmospheric hydrology and boundary layer processes. Soil temperature and moisture that have a much slower spinup than the atmosphere are cycled from 48-h output of earlier runs. Arctic conditions are simulated for a winter-to-summer seasonal cycle from 15 November 2006 to 1 August 2007. Simulation results are compared with a variety of observations from several Alaskan sites, with emphasis on the North Slope. Polar WRF simulation results show good agreement with most near-surface observations. Warm temperature biases are found for winter and summer. A sensitivity experiment with reduced soil heat conductivity, however, improves simulation of near-surface temperature, ground heat flux, and soil temperature during winter. There is a marked deficit in summer cloud cover over land with excessive incident shortwave radiation. The cloud deficit may result from anomalous vertical mixing of moisture by the turbulence parameterization. The new snow albedo parameterization for WRF 3.1.1 is successfully tested for snowmelt over the North Slope of Alaska.},

abstract = {We describe the history and spatial distribution of day-of-week differences in ambient ozone, NOx, and VOC concentrations through the analysis of two decades of measurements from sites located throughout California. Spectral analysis of the concentration time series shows that weekly patterns in ozone concentrations, typically with higher values of ozone on weekends, have become more widespread in California between 1980 and 1999. In contrast, a strong weekly pattern in NO, concentrations has been present throughout the entire period, and weekly patterns in VOC concentrations, though not as evident, have also been present during the entire 20-yr period. We examine 8-h average ozone concentrations, which appear to be a more sensitive measure of day-of-week differences in ozone than are 1-h averages. At sites with significant weekly cycles, fluctuations in pollutant concentrations that occur on a weekly time scale account for 6.6+/-3.5{\%}, 3.0+/-1.7{\%}, and 2.1+/-0.9{\%} of the total variance in NOx, NMHC, and ozone concentrations, respectively. Concentrations of all three pollutants have been declining in most locations over the past 20 yr. Our results support the hypothesis that the weekend ozone effect is due to a combination of VOC-sensitivity and reduced NO, emissions on weekends. The spread of the weekend ozone effect may be due to a shift in ozone formation towards VOC-sensitivity, as control programs have reduced emissions of VOC more than NOx.

abstract = {The Arctic radiation balance is strongly affected by clouds and surface albedo. Prior work has identified Arctic cloud liquid water path (LWP) and surface radiative flux biases in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), and reductions to these biases with improved mixed-phase ice nucleation schemes. Here, CAM5 net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) Arctic radiative flux biases are quantified along with the contributions of clouds, surface albedos, and new mixed-phase ice nucleation schemes to these biases.CAM5netTOAall- sky shortwave (SW) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) fluxes are generally within 10Wm22 of Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled (CERES-EBAF) observations. How- ever, CAM5 has compensating SW errors: Surface albedos over snow are too high while cloud amount and LWP are too low. Use of a new CAM5 Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar simulator that corrects an error in the treatment of snow crystal size confirms insufficient cloud amount in CAM5 year-round. CAM5 OLR is too low because of low surface temperature in winter, excessive atmospheric water vapor in summer, and excessive cloud heights year-round. Simulations with two new mixed-phase ice nucleation schemes—one based on an empirical fit to ice nuclei observations and one based on classical nucleation theory with prognostic ice nuclei—improve surface climate in winter by in- creasing cloud amount andLWP.However, netTOAand surface radiation biases remain because of increases in midlevel clouds and a persistent deficit in cloud LWP. These findings highlight challenges with evaluating and modeling Arctic cloud, radiation, and climate processes. 1.},

abstract = {An aspect of anthropogenic impacts on climate have been assessed by examining the day-of-the-week variation (DOWV) of important meteorological elements. The data used were those of daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall for Melbourne for the period 1856{\^{a}}1990. This long series has been broken up into five 27-yr subperiods to expose how any such variation has changed over the record. We find there to be no DOWV in the summer {\^{a}}half{\^{a}} of the year for any of the subperiods. The only statistically significant variations to have physical meaning occur in the winter of the most recent subperiod (1964{\^{a}}1990). In that time maximum temperature exhibits a significant (10{\%} confidence level) DOWV and weekdays are 0.29{\^{A}}°C warmer than weekends (5{\%}). Minimum temperatures and rainfall amounts were also found to be greater (10{\%} level) on weekdays by 0.24{\^{A}}°C and 0.20 mm d{\^{a}}1, respectively.

We have considered the possible impacts of day-of-the-week variation of atmospheric pollution loading and of the local generation of heat. We hypothesise that the magnitude of the contrast between weekday-weekend anthropogenic heat emissions is sufficient to explain the temperature differences and these in turn are consistent with the weekday excess of rainfall. This perspective is concordant with the results of many recent studies which stress the importance of anthropogenic heating.},

abstract = {Surface solar radiation measurements have been made at many meteorological sites for long periods. These data potentially provide higher temporal resolution cloud amount information than traditional estimations of cloud amount recorded in eighths of the sky obscured (oktas). To utilise existing solar radiation datasets for this, two quantities are derived from the surface measurements of global (G) and diffuse (D) solar irradiance, and top of atmosphere solar irradiance (E) - the Diffuse Fraction (DF = D/G) and the Opaqueness (Op = 1 - G/E). These are compared with subjective cloud observations made at Reading daily during 1997 to 2006. This shows that DF measurements are sensitive to cloud amount, particularly for low and moderate cloud coverage. Complimentary information is available in Op, which is particularly sensitive to cloud amount in moderate to overcast cloud coverage. In overcast conditions, DF = 1, during which Op provides a measure of overcast cloud thickness. As well as cloud amount, the variability in DF and Op provides a basis for discriminating between cumuliform and stratiform cloud: large variability indicates convective cloud whereas only small variability occurs under stratiform cloud. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

While SMB processes are beginning to be well captured by observationally-constrained climate modeling, insight into D is relatively limited. We use InSAR-derived velocities, in combination with ice thickness observations, to quantify the mass flux (F) across a flux perimeter around the ice sheet at ∼1700 m elevation. To quantify D, we correct F for SMB, as well as changes in volume due to ice dynamics, in the area downstream of the gate. Using a 1961–1990 reference climatology SMB field from the MAR regional climate model, we quantify ice sheet mass balance within eighteen basins. We find a 2007–2011 mean D of 515±57 Gtyr−1. We find a 2007–2011 mean total mass balance of −262±21 Gtyr−1, which is equal to a 0.73 mm yr−1 global sea level rise contribution. This mass loss is dominated by SMB, which accounts for 61{\%} of mass loss in the basins where partitioning is possible.},

Here, we simulate shallow warm clouds on 05/27/2011 at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) measurement site established by Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program using a single column version of a global climate model (CAM5.3) and a cloud resolving model (CRM). The LWP simulated by CAM increases substantially with aerosol loading while that in the CRM does not. The increase of LWP in CAM is caused by a large decrease of the autoconversion rate when cloud droplet number increases. In the CRM, the autoconversion rate is also reduced, but this is offset or even outweighed by the increased evaporation of cloud droplets near cloud top, resulting in an overall decrease in LWP. Our results suggest that climate models need to include the dependence of cloud top growth and the evaporation/condensation process on cloud droplet number concentrations.},

abstract = {An accurate characterization of the vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere is useful in climate change and attribution studies as well as for the climate modelling community to improve projections of future climate over this highly sensitive region. Here, we investigate one of the dominant features of the vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere, i.e. water-vapour inversions, using eight years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder data (2002-2010) and radiosounding profiles released from the two Arctic locations (North Slope of Alaska at Barrow and during SHEBA). We quantify the characteristics of clear-sky water vapour inversions in terms of their frequency of occurrence, strength and height covering the entire Arctic for the first time. We found that the frequency of occurrence of water-vapour inversions is highest during winter and lowest during summer. The inversion strength is, however, higher during summer. The observed peaks in the median inversion-layer heights are higher during the winter half of the year, at around 850 hPa over most of the Arctic Ocean, Siberia and the Canadian Archipelago, while being around 925 hPa during most of the summer half of the year over the Arctic Ocean. The radiosounding profiles agree with the frequency, location and strength of water-vapour inversions in the Pacific sector of the Arctic. In addition, the radiosoundings indicate that multiple inversions are the norm with relatively few cases without inversions. The amount of precipitable water within the water-vapour inversion structures is estimated and we find a distinct, two-mode contribution to the total column precipitable water. These results suggest that water-vapour inversions are a significant source to the column thermodynamics, especially during the colder winter and spring seasons. We argue that these inversions are a robust metric to test the reproducibility of thermodynamics within climate models. An accurate statistical representation of water-vapour inversions in models would mean that the large-scale coupling of moisture transport, precipitation, temperature and water-vapour vertical structure and radiation are essentially captured well in such models.},

We find that over Greenland, most of the models have insufficient cloud cover during summer. In addition, all models create too few non-opaque liquid containing clouds optically thin enough to let direct solar radiation reach the surface (-1{\%} to -3.5{\%} at the ground level). Some models create too few opaque clouds.

A 10 day episode combining intense biomass burning over Siberia and low-pressure systems over the Arctic Ocean resulted in efficient transport of plumes containing black carbon (BC) towards the Arctic, mostly in the upper troposphere (6{\&}ndash;8{\&}thinsp;km). A combination of in situ observations (DLR Falcon aircraft), satellite analysis and WRF-Chem simulations are used to understand the vertical and horizontal transport mechanisms of BC with a focus on the role of wet removal. Between the northwestern Norwegian coast and the Svalbard archipelago, the Falcon aircraft sampled plumes with enhanced CO concentrations up to 200{\&}thinsp;ppbv and BC mixing ratios up to 25{\&}thinsp;ng{\&}thinsp;kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} . During transport to the Arctic region, a large fraction of BC particles are scavenged by two wet deposition processes, namely wet removal by large-scale precipitation and removal in wet convective updrafts, with both processes contributing almost equally to the total accumulated deposition of BC. Our results underline that applying a ﬁner horizontal resolution (40 instead of 100{\&}thinsp;km) improves the model performance, as it significantly reduces the overestimation of BC levels observed at a coarser resolution in the mid-troposphere. According to the simulations at 40{\&}thinsp;km, the transport efficiency of BC (TE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) in biomass burning plumes is about 60{\&}thinsp;{\%}, which is impacted by small accumulated precipitation along trajectory (APT) (1{\&}thinsp;mm). In contrast TE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is very small ({\textless}{\&}thinsp;30{\&}thinsp;{\%}) and APT is larger (5{\&}ndash;10{\&}thinsp;mm) in plumes inﬂuenced by urban anthropogenic sources and ﬂaring activities in Northern Russia, resulting in transport to lower altitudes. TE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} due to grid scale precipitation is responsible for a sharp meridional gradient in the distribution of BC concentrations. Wet removal in subgrid parameterized clouds (cumuli) is the cause of modeled vertical gradient of TE{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} , especially in the mid-latitudes, reﬂecting the distribution of convective precipitation, but is dominated in the Arctic region by the grid-scale wet removal associated with the formation of stratocumulus clouds in the PBL that produced frequent drizzle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The exchange rates of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) between 19 tree species and the atmosphere were investigated under natural field conditions using a static enclosure. Most of the investigated trees acted as sinks for atmospheric COS and a few trees, such as Salix matsudana Koidz. and Ulmus pumila L. could emit COS. The distinct diurnal variations of COS uptake for the investigated trees indicated that COS uptake strongly depended on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The average COS uptake rates for most species were much higher in summer than in autumn, indicating leaf age and temperature also might be the important influencing factors for COS uptake. Platanus orientalis L., Sophara japonica var. P. loud., Magnolia denudata Desr. and Sophora japonica L. were capable of continuously absorbing COS in daytime as well as in nighttime. For Platanus orientalis L., the maximal COS uptake rate and DMS emission rate on a single leaf area basis were −15.29 and 0.42 pmol m−2 s−1, respectively.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Summer storage of snow for tourism has seen an increasing interest in the last years. Covering large snow piles with materials such as sawdust enables more than two-thirds of the initial snow volume to be conserved. We present detailed mass balance measurements of two sawdust-covered snow piles obtained by terrestrial laser scanning during summer 2015. Results indicate that 74 and 63 {\%} of the snow volume remained over the summer for piles in Davos, Switzerland and Martell, Italy. If snow mass is considered instead of volume, the values increase to 83 and 72 {\%}. The difference is attributed to settling and densification of the snow. Additionally, we adapted the one-dimensional, physically based snow cover model SNOWPACK to perform simulations of the sawdust-covered snow piles. Model results and measurements agreed extremely well at the point scale. Moreover, we analysed the contribution of the different terms of the surface energy balance to snow ablation for a pile covered with a 40 cm thick sawdust layer and a pile without insulation. Short-wave radiation was the dominant source of energy for both scenarios, but the moist sawdust caused strong cooling by long-wave emission and negative sensible and latent heat fluxes. This cooling effect reduces the energy available for melt by up to a factor of 12. As a result only 9 {\%} of the net short-wave energy remained available for melt. Finally, sensitivity studies of the parameters {\textless}q{\textgreater}thickness of the sawdust layer{\textless}/q{\textgreater}, {\textless}q{\textgreater}air temperature{\textless}/q{\textgreater}, {\textless}q{\textgreater}precipitation{\textless}/q{\textgreater} and {\textless}q{\textgreater}wind speed{\textless}/q{\textgreater} were performed. We show that sawdust thickness has a tremendous effect on snow loss. Higher air temperatures and wind speeds increase snow ablation but less significantly. No significant effect of additional precipitation could be found as the sawdust remained wet during the entire summer with the measured quantity of rain. Setting precipitation amounts to zero, however, strongly increased melt. Overall, the 40 cm sawdust provides sufficient protection for mid-elevation (approx. 1500 m a.s.l.) Alpine climates and can be managed with reasonable effort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The years since the introduction of MERRA have seen numerous advances in the GEOS-5 Data Assimilation System as well as a substantial decrease in the number of observations that can be assimilated into the MERRA system. To allow continued data processing into the future, and to take advantage of several important innovations that could improve system performance, a decision was made to produce MERRA-2, an updated retrospective analysis of the full modern satellite era. One of the many advances in MERRA-2 is a constraint on the global dry mass balance; this allows the global changes in water by the analysis increment to be near zero, thereby minimizing abrupt global interannual variations due to changes in the observing system. In addition, MERRA-2 includes the assimilation of interactive aerosols into the system, a feature of the Earth system absent from previous reanalyses. Also, in an effort to improve land surface hydrology, observations-corrected precipitation forcing is used instead of model-generated precipitation. Overall, MERRA-2 takes advantage of numerous updates to the global modeling and data assimilation system. In this document, we summarize an initial evaluation of the climate inMERRA-2, from the surface to the stratosphere and from the tropics to the poles. Strengths and weaknesses of the MERRA-2 climate are accordingly emphasized.},

abstract = {Meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet contributed 1.7–6.12 mm to global sea level between 1993 and 2010 and is expected to contribute 20–110 mm to future sea level rise by 2100. These estimates were produced by regional climate models (RCMs) which are known to be robust at the ice sheet scale but occasionally miss regional- and local-scale climate variability (e.g. Leeson et al., 2017; Medley et al., 2013). To date, the fidelity of these models in the context of short-period variability in time (i.e. intra-seasonal) has not been fully assessed, for example their ability to simulate extreme temperature events. We use an event identification algorithm commonly used in extreme value analysis, together with observations from the Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net), to assess the ability of the MAR (Mod{\`{e}}le Atmosph{\'{e}}rique R{\'{e}}gional) RCM to reproduce observed extreme positive-temperature events at 14 sites around Greenland. We find that MAR is able to accurately simulate the frequency and duration of these events but underestimates their magnitude by more than half a degree Celsius/kelvin, although this bias is much smaller than that exhibited by coarse-scale Era-Interim reanalysis data. As a result, melt energy in MAR output is underestimated by between 16 and 41 {\%} depending on global forcing applied. Further work is needed to precisely determine the drivers of extreme temperature events, and why the model underperforms in this area, but our findings suggest that biases are passed into MAR from boundary forcing data. This is important because these forcings are common between RCMs and their range of predictions of past and future ice sheet melting. We propose that examining extreme events should become a routine part of global and regional climate model evaluation and that addressing shortcomings in this area should be a priority for model development.},

abstract = {Data collected during July and August from the Arctic Ocean Experiment 2001 illustrated a common occurrence of specific-humidity (q) inversions, where moisture increases with height, coinciding with temperature inversions in the central Arctic boundary layer and lower troposphere. Low-level stratiform clouds and their relationship to temperature inversions are examined using radiosonde data and data from a suite of remote sensing instrumentation. Two low-level cloud regimes are identified: the canonical case of stratiform clouds, where the cloud tops are capped by the temperature inversion base (CCI-Clouds Capped by Inversion) and clouds where the cloud tops were found well inside the inversion (CII-Clouds Inside Inversion). The latter case was found to occur more than twice as frequently than the former. The characteristic of the temperature inversion is shown to have an influence on the cloud regime that was supported. Statistical analyses of the cloud regimes using remote sensing instruments suggest that CCI cases tend to be dominated by single-phase liquid cloud droplets; radiative cooling at the cloud top limits the vertical extent of such clouds to the inversion base height. The CII cases, on the other hand, display characteristics that can be divided into two situations-(1) clouds that only slightly penetrate the temperature inversion and exhibit a microphysical signal similar to CCI cases, or (2) clouds that extend higher into the inversion and show evidence of a mixed-phase cloud structure. An important interplay between the mixed-phase structure and an increased potential for turbulent mixing across the inversion base appears to support the lifetime of CII cases existing within the inversion layer.},

abstract = {Northern midlatitudes, over central Eurasia in particular, have experienced frequent severe winters in recent decades1–3. A remote influence of Arctic sea-ice loss has been suggested4–14; however, the importance of this connection remains controversial because of discrepancies among modelling and between modelling and observational studies15–17. Here, using a hybrid analysis of observations and multi-model large ensembles from seven atmospheric general circulation models, we examine the cause of these differences. While all models capture the observed structure of the forced surface temperature response to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas—including Eurasian cooling—we show that its magnitude is systematically underestimated. Owing to the varying degrees of this underestimation of sea-ice-forced signal, the signal-to-noise ratio differs markedly. Correcting this underestimation reconciles the discrepancy between models and observations, leading to the conclusion that {\~{}}44{\%} of the central Eurasian cooling trend for 1995–2014 is attributable to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas. Our results strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has significantly amplified the probability of severe winter occurrence in central Eurasia via enhanced melting of the Barents–Kara sea ice. The difference in underestimation of signal-to-noise ratio between models therefore calls for careful experimental design and interpretation for regional climate change attribution.},

abstract = {A modal aerosol module (MAM) has been de- veloped for the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). MAM is capable of simulating the aerosol size distribution and both internal and external mixing between aerosol components, treating numerous complicated aerosol processes and aerosol phys- ical, chemical and optical properties in a physically-based manner. Two MAM versions were developed: a more com- plete version with seven lognormal modes (MAM7), and a version with three lognormal modes (MAM3) for the purpose of long-term (decades to centuries) simulations. In this paper a description and evaluation of the aerosol module and its two representations are provided. Sensitivity of the aerosol lifecycle to simplifications in the representation of aerosol is discussed. Simulated sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass concentrations are remarkably similar between MAM3 and MAM7. Differences in primary organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) concentrations between MAM3 and MAM7are also small (mostly within 10 {\%}). The mineral dust global burden differs by 10{\%}and sea salt burden by 30–40{\%} betweenMAM3and MAM7, mainly due to the different size ranges for dust and sea salt modes and different standard de- viations of the log-normal size distribution for sea salt modes between MAM3 and MAM7. The model is able to qualita- tively capture the observed geographical and temporal vari- ations of aerosol mass and number concentrations, size dis- tributions, and aerosol optical properties. However, there are noticeable biases; e.g., simulated BC concentrations are sig- nificantly lower than measurements in the Arctic. There is a low bias in modeled aerosol optical depth on the global scale, especially in the developing countries. These biases in aerosol simulations clearly indicate the need for improve- ments of aerosol processes (e.g., emission fluxes of anthro- pogenic aerosols and precursor gases in developing coun- tries, boundary layer nucleation) and properties (e.g., pri- mary aerosol emission size, POM hygroscopicity). In addi- tion, the critical role of cloud properties (e.g., liquid water content, cloud fraction) responsible for the wet scavenging of aerosol is highlighted.},

abstract = {Regional climate change can arise from three different effects: regional changes to the amount of radiative heating that reaches the Earth's surface, an inhomogeneous response to globally uniform changes in radiative heating and variability without a specific forcing. The relative importance of these effects is not clear, particularly because neither the response to regional forcings nor the regional forcings themselves are well known for the twentieth century. Here we investigate the sensitivity of regional climate to changes in carbon dioxide, black carbon aerosols, sulphate aerosols and ozone in the tropics, mid-latitudes and polar regions, using a coupled ocean–atmosphere model. We find that mid- and high-latitude climate is quite sensitive to the location of the forcing. Using these relationships between forcing and response along with observations of twentieth century climate change, we reconstruct radiative forcing from aerosols in space and time. Our reconstructions broadly agree with historical emissions estimates, and can explain the differences between observed changes in Arctic temperatures and expectations from non-aerosol forcings plus unforced variability. We conclude that decreasing concentrations of sulphate aerosols and increasing concentrations of black carbon have substantially contributed to rapid Arctic warming during the past three decades.},

In this study, the satellite observations are used to heuristically separate polar thin ice clouds into two crystal size categories, and an aerosol index based on the attenuated backscattering and color ratio of the sampled volumes is used for identifying haze in cloud-free regions. Statistics from 386 Arctic satellite overpasses during January 2007 and from 379 overpasses over Antarctica during July 2007 reveal that sectors with the highest proportion of thin ice clouds having large ice crystals at their top are those for which the aerosol index is highest. Moreover, a weak but significant correlation between the cloud top ice effective radius and the above-cloud aerosol index suggests that more polluted clouds tend to have higher ice effective radius, in 10 of the 11 sectors investigated. These results are interpreted in terms of a sulphate-induced freezing inhibition effect.},

Recently, there have been considerable advances in understanding the physical contributions to AA, and progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that link it to midlatitude weather variability. Observational studies overwhelmingly support that AA is contributing to winter continental cooling. Although some model experiments support the observational evidence, most modelling results show little connection between AA and severe midlatitude weather or suggest the export of excess heating from the Arctic to lower latitudes. Divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and even intramodel studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding of how AA is influencing midlatitude weather. Amplified warming in the Arctic has been linked to weather variability in the midlatitudes. This Review considers the evidence from both observations and modelling studies on this link for increasing severe winter weather, including cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls.},

abstract = {The theoretical basis for the link between the leaf exchange of carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and water vapour (H(2)O) and the assumptions that need to be made in order to use COS as a tracer for canopy net photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance, are reviewed. The ratios of COS to CO(2) and H(2)O deposition velocities used to this end are shown to vary with the ratio of the internal to ambient CO(2) and H(2)O mole fractions and the relative limitations by boundary layer, stomatal and internal conductance for COS. It is suggested that these deposition velocity ratios exhibit considerable variability, a finding that challenges current parameterizations, which treat these as vegetation-specific constants. COS is shown to represent a better tracer for CO(2) than H(2)O. Using COS as a tracer for stomatal conductance is hampered by our present poor understanding of the leaf internal conductance to COS. Estimating canopy level CO(2) and H(2)O fluxes requires disentangling leaf COS exchange from other ecosystem sources/sinks of COS. We conclude that future priorities for COS research should be to improve the quantitative understanding of the variability in the ratios of COS to CO(2) and H(2)O deposition velocities and the controlling factors, and to develop operational methods for disentangling ecosystem COS exchange into contributions by leaves and other sources/sinks. To this end, integrated studies, which concurrently quantify the ecosystem-scale CO(2), H(2)O and COS exchange and the corresponding component fluxes, are urgently needed.},

New physically based parameterizations are developed for simulating homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation, droplet activation, and the spectral index (width) of the droplet size spectra. Two versions of the scheme are described: one for application in high-resolution cloud models and the other for simulating grid-scale cloudiness in larger-scale models. The versions differ in their treatment of the supersaturation field and droplet nucleation. For the high-resolution approach, droplet nucleation is calculated from Kohler theory applied to a distribution of aerosol that activates at a given supersaturation. The resolved supersaturation field and condensation/deposition rates are predicted using a semianalytic approximation to the three-phase (vapor, ice, liquid) supersaturation equation.

abstract = {Abstract. One consequence of recent Arctic warming is an increased occurrence and longer seasonality of above-freezing air temperature episodes. There is significant disagreement in the literature concerning potential physical connectivity between high-latitude open water duration proximate to the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and unseasonal (i.e. late summer and autumn) GrIS melt events. Here, a new date of sea ice advance (DOA) product is used to determine the occurrence of Baffin Bay sea ice growth along Greenland's west coast for the 2011{\&}ndash;2015 period. For the unseasonal melt period preceding the DOA, northwest Atlantic Ocean and atmospheric conditions are analyzed and linked to unseasonal melt events observed at a series of on-ice automatic weather stations (AWS) along the K-transect in southwest Greenland. Mesoscale and synoptic influences on the above and below freezing surface air temperature events are assessed through analyses of AWS wind, pressure, and humidity observations. These surface observations are further compared against Mod{\`{e}}le Atmosph{\'{e}}rique R{\'{e}}gional (MAR), Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2), and ERA-Interim reanalysis fields to understand the airmass origins and (thermo)dynamic drivers of the melt events. Results suggest that the K-transect late season, ablation zone melt events are strongly affected by ridging atmospheric circulation patterns that transport warm, moist air from the sub-polar North Atlantic toward west Greenland. While thermal conduction and advection off south Baffin Bay open waters impact coastal air temperatures, consistent with previous studies, marine air incursions from Baffin Bay onto the ice sheet are obstructed by barrier flows and the pressure gradient-driven katabatic regime along the western GrIS margin.},

abstract = {Two aircraft missions to sample the boundary layer dynamics associated with the intense katabatic wind$\backslash$nregime at Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica were flown on successive days in early November 1987. Light winds$\backslash$naveraging 5 m s- 1 were monitored at the 170 m flight level over the interior of the ice sheet. Dramatic acceleration$\backslash$nof the airflow and abrupt 5°-7°C cooling were encountered on both days near the head of Reeves Glacier just$\backslash$nupslope from where the terrain steepens considerably. These results suggest that much of the airflow convergence$\backslash$nwhich sustains the coastal katabatic winds is forced by localized topographic channeling into Reeves Glacier,$\backslash$nand that the descending airstream is negatively buoyant. The horizontally propagating katabatic winds were$\backslash$nfollowed for 250 km directly offshore and for 200 km southward parallel to the Victoria Land coast; the airstream$\backslash$nmomentum gradually decreased along both tlight paths.$\backslash$nIn conjunction with the descent of negatively buoyant air down Reeves Glacier and horizontal flow across$\backslash$nNansen Ice Sheet, thermal infrared satellite images showed a warm katabatic signature along the trajectory.$\backslash$nThis paradox is explained by vigorous vertical mixing within the katabatic layer which makes the temperature$\backslash$nof the emitting snow surface beneath the katabatic jet much warmer than that for adjacent light-wind areas.$\backslash$nThermal images often suggest that katabatic winds propagate for hundreds of kilometers beyond the slope break;$\backslash$nthis interpretation is strongly supported by the offshore aircraft data.$\backslash$nPrimitive-equation model simulations for the aircraft flight level reproduced the light, nearly frictionless,$\backslash$ncontour-parallel winds seen in the interior. The model also reproduced the abrupt airflow acceleration near the$\backslash$nhead of Reeves Glacier. Maximum speeds within the steeply-sloping glacier valley are underestimated, however,$\backslash$nand it appears that a much finer grid spacing than 32 km is required to accurately simulate katabatic drainage$\backslash$nthrough the complex coastal mountains.},

abstract = {[1] The spatial and temporal variability of the global fluxes of carbonyl sulfide (COS) is discussed together with possible implications for total column atmospheric COS loading. The input of COS into the atmosphere is calculated as the sum of all known direct sources of COS plus the conversion of carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to COS by atmospheric oxidation processes. Recent models are used to predict COS, CS2, and DMS release from the oceans and COS uptake by soils, plants, and oceans. This forward approach to constructing global integrated COS fluxes has a large associated range of uncertainty. The best guess global annual-integrated COS net flux estimate does not differ from zero within the range of estimated uncertainty, consistent with the observed absence of long-term trends in atmospheric COS loading. Interestingly, the hemispheric time-dependent monthly fluxes are very close in phase for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The monthly variation of the Northern Hemisphere flux seems to be driven primarily by high COS vegetation uptake in summer, while the monthly variation of the Southern Hemisphere flux appears to be driven mostly by high oceanic fluxes of COS, CS2, and DMS in summer.},

In the Himalayas, radiative fluxes are occasionally measured, but very limited observations of turbulent fluxes on debris-covered tongues exist to date. We present measurements collected between 26 September and 12 October 2016 from an eddy correlation system installed on the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal during the transition between monsoon and post-monsoon. Our observations suggest that surface energy losses through turbulent fluxes reduce the positive net radiative fluxes during daylight hours between 10 and 100{\%}, and even lead to a net negative surface energy balance after noon. During clear days, turbulent flux losses increase to over 250 W m−2 mainly due to high sensible heat fluxes. During overcast days the latent heat flux dominates the turbulent losses and together they reach just above 100 W m−2. Subsequently, we validate the performance of three bulk approaches in reproducing the observations from the eddy correlation system. Large differences exist between the approaches, and accurate estimates of surface temperature, wind speed, and surface roughness are necessary for their performance to be reasonable. Moreover, the tested bulk approaches generally overestimate turbulent latent heat fluxes by a factor 3 on clear days, because the debris-covered surface dries out rapidly, while the bulk equations assume surface saturation. Improvements to bulk surface energy models should therefore include the drying process of the surface. A sensitivity analysis suggests that, in order to be useful in distributed melt models, an accurate extrapolation of wind speed, surface temperature and surface roughness in space is a prerequisite. By applying the best performing bulk model over a complete melt period, we show that turbulent fluxes reduce the available energy for melt at the debris surface by 17{\%} even at very low wind speeds. Overall, we conclude that turbulent fluxes play an essential role in the surface energy balance of debris-covered glaciers and that it is essential to include them in melt models.},

abstract = {The objectives of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Enhanced Shortwave Experiment (ARESE) are to directly measure clear and cloudy sky shortwave atmospheric absorption and to quantify any absorption found in excess of model predictions. We undertake detailed model comparisons to near-infrared and total solar flux time series observed by surface and airborne radiometric instruments during the ARESE campaign. Model clear- sky absorption biases generally fall within the range of uncertainty generated by sample size, and assumptions of aerosol properties and surface albedo. Direct measurements by stacked aircraft on the overcast day of October 30, 1995, confirm the detection of enhanced cloud shortwave absorption during ARESE. The detection is substantiated by, and consistent with, three independent measures of cloudy sky absorption estimated in previous studies: cloud forcing ratio, insolation forcing ratio, and albedo/transmission slope. A significant portion of the enhanced absorption occurs at visible wavelengths. Collocated measurements of liquid water path (LWP) suggest the magnitude of the enhanced absorption increases with LWP.},

abstract = {Global observations of cloud and humidity distributions in the upper troposphere within all geophysical conditions are critically important in order to monitor the present climate and to provide necessary data for validation of climate models to project future climate change. Towards this end, tropical oceanic distributions of thin cirrus optical depth (tau), effective diameter (D(e)), and relative humidity with respect to ice (RH(i)) within cirrus (RH(ic)) are simultaneously derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Corresponding increases in D(e) and cloud temperature are shown for cirrus with tau {\textgreater} 0.25 that demonstrate quantitative consistency to other surface-based, in situ and satellite retrievals. However, inferred cirrus properties are shown to be less certain for increasingly tenuous cirrus. In-cloud supersaturation is observed for 8-12{\%} of thin cirrus and is several factors higher than all-sky conditions; even higher frequencies are shown for the coldest and thinnest cirrus. Spatial and temporal variations in RH(ic) correspond to cloud frequency while regional variability in RH(ic) is observed to be most prominent over the N. Indian Ocean basin. The largest cloud/clear sky RH(i) anomalies tend to occur in dry regions associated with vertical descent in the sub-tropics, while the smallest occur in moist ascending regions in the tropics. The characteristics of RH(ic) frequency distributions depend on tau and a peak frequency is located between 60-80{\%} that illustrates RH(ic) is on average biased dry. The geometrical thickness of cirrus is typically less than the vertical resolution of AIRS temperature and specific humidity profiles and thus leads to the observed dry bias, shown with coincident cloud vertical structure obtained from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The joint distributions of thin cirrus microphysics and humidity derived from AIRS provide unique and important regional and global-scale insights on upper tropospheric processes not available from surface, in situ, and other contemporary satellite observing platforms.},

The Arctic has a long history of natural, abrupt climate changes, which together with current observations and model projections, can help us to identify which parts of the Arctic climate system might pass future tipping points. Here the climate tipping points are defined, noting that not all of them involve bifurcations leading to irreversible change. Past abrupt climate changes in the Arctic are briefly reviewed. Then, the current behaviour of a range of Arctic systems is summarised. Looking ahead, a range of potential tipping phenomena are described. This leads to a revised and expanded list of potential Arctic climate tipping elements, whose likelihood is assessed, in terms of how much warming will be required to tip them. Finally, the available responses are considered, especially the prospects for avoiding Arctic climate tipping points.},

abstract = {Solar radiation at the Earth's surface is an important driver of meteorological and ecological processes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the reanalysis solar radiation produced by NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis) and MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) against the FLUXNET measurements in North America. We found that both assimilation systems systematically overestimated the surface solar radiation flux on the monthly and annual scale, with an average bias error of +37.2 Wm(-2) for NARR and of +20.2 Wm(-2) for MERRA. The bias errors were larger under cloudy skies than under clear skies. A postreanalysis algorithm consisting of empirical relationships between model bias, a clearness index, and site elevation was proposed to correct the model errors. Results show that the algorithm can remove the systematic bias errors for both FLUXNET calibration sites (sites used to establish the algorithm) and independent validation sites. After correction, the average annual mean bias errors were reduced to +1.3 Wm(-2) for NARR and +2.7 Wm(-2) for MERRA. Applying the correction algorithm to the global domain of MERRA brought the global mean surface incoming shortwave radiation down by 17.3 W m(-2) to 175.5 W m(-2). Under the constraint of the energy balance, other radiation and energy balance terms at the Earth's surface, estimated from independent global data products, also support the need for a downward adjustment of the MERRA surface solar radiation.},

abstract = {Abstract. The mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) in a warming climate is of critical interest to scientists and the general public in the context of future sea-level rise. Increased melting in the GrIS percolation zone due to atmospheric warming over the past several decades has led to increased mass loss at lower elevations. Previous studies have hypothesized that this warming is accompanied by a precipitation increase, as would be expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, negating some of the melt-induced mass loss throughout the Western GrIS. This study tests that hypothesis by calculating snow accumulation rates and trends across the Western GrIS percolation zone, providing new critical accumulation estimates in regions with sparse and/or dated in situ data for calibration of future regional climate models. We present accumulation records from sixteen 22{\&}ndash;32{\&}thinsp;m long firn cores and 4436{\&}thinsp;km of ground penetrating-radar, covering the past 20{\&}ndash;60 years of accumulation, collected across the Western GrIS percolation zone as part of the Greenland Traverse for Accumulation and Climate Studies (GreenTrACS) project. Trends from both radar and firn cores, as well as commonly used regional climate models, show decreasing accumulation and precipitation over the 1996{\&}ndash;2016 period, which we attribute to shifting storm-tracks related to stronger atmospheric summer blocking over Greenland. Changes in atmospheric circulation over the past 20 years, specifically anomalously high summertime blocking, have reduced GrIS surface mass balance through both an increase in surface melting and a decrease in accumulation.},

abstract = {Abstract This study uses an extensive dataset of monthly surface air temperature (SAT) records (including previously unutilized) from high-latitude ({\textgreater}60°N) meteorological land stations. Most records have been updated by very recent observations (up to December 2008). Using these data, a high-latitude warming rate of 1.36°C century−1 is documented for 1875–2008—the trend is almost 2 times stronger than the Northern Hemisphere trend (0.79°C century−1), with an accelerated warming rate in the most recent decade (1.35°C decade−1). Stronger warming in high-latitude regions is a manifestation of polar amplification (PA). Changes in SAT suggest two spatial scales of PA—hemispheric and local. A new stable statistical measure of PA linking high-latitude and hemispheric temperature anomalies via a regression relationship is proposed. For 1875–2008, this measure yields PA of ∼1.62. Local PA related to the ice–albedo feedback mechanisms is autumnal and coastal, extending several hundred kilometers inland. Heat budget...},

abstract = {AbstractA full understanding of the causes of the severe drought seen in the Sahel in the latter part of the twentieth-century remains elusive some 25 yr after the height of the event. Previous studies have suggested that this drying trend may be explained by either decadal modes of natural variability or by human-driven emissions (primarily aerosols), but these studies lacked a sufficiently large number of models to attribute one cause over the other. In this paper, signatures of both aerosol and greenhouse gas changes on Sahel rainfall are illustrated. These idealized responses are used to interpret the results of historical Sahel rainfall changes from two very large ensembles of fully coupled climate models, which both sample uncertainties arising from internal variability and model formulation. The sizes of these ensembles enable the relative role of human-driven changes and natural variability on historic Sahel rainfall to be assessed. The paper demonstrates that historic aerosol changes are likely t...},

abstract = {An important potential source of error in snow albedo measurements under clear sky is the tilt of the surface when the sensors are placed parallel to the horizon. The error depends on the surface slope and aspect. A hemispherical radiation sensor receives its signal from within a surface area of several square meters., which generally is not a plane. Here we examined the influence of slope and aspect combinations related to surface irregularities on albedo measurements at two locations on the Zongo Glacier, Bolivia. The slope and aspect distributions determined through topographic measurements were used to correct the albedo measurements. The corrections were different between the two sites but resulted in similar albedo changes: the substantial albedo reductions observed from morning until evening were measurement artifacts. Even for slight slopes. an error of a few degrees on the slope estimation or an error of roughly 20degrees on the aspect estimation had an appreciable influence on the corrections, If the topography around the measurement site is not precisely, known, the most reliable method for determining the daily albedo is to observed the measurements around solar noon. Corrected albedo diurnal variations were loan and symmetrical. centered on a minimum at noon. During the dry season (the Southern Hemisphere winter), the diurnal fluctuations of the snow albedo on the Zongo Glacier seem to be controlled by the incidence angle cycle of solar radiation.},

abstract = {This study assesses the simulations of the daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures and daily precipitation over China during the period 1990−1999, based on phase 3 and phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). Fourteen CMIP3 models and 14 CMIP5 models were investigated over eight regions across China. Skill scores quantifying the match between the simulated and observed probability density functions (PDFs) were applied to evaluate the performance of the models. For daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, the results revealed that CMIP3 and CMIP5 models captured the basic pattern of the observed PDFs in all regions. However, the probabilities at lower values were overestimated in most models. In all regions except the west of Northwest China (region 7), all CMIP5 models captured more than 80{\%} of the observed PDFs. Compared with performance at the annual timescale, the models tended to perform relatively worse over the period June to August. The performances of the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models were not as good for daily precipitation as for daily temperature, and the skill scores for precipitation were generally lower than 0.7 in all regions. The amount of drizzle (daily precipitation {\textless} 5 mm) was overestimated notably in all regions. The amount of very heavy precipitation (daily precipitation ≥ 20 mm) tended to be underestimated in humid regions but overestimated in arid regions. Compared with CMIP3, CMIP5 models showed some improvements in the simulation of daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, but there was a lack of apparent improvement for simulation of daily precipitation.},

abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet is now the largest land ice contributor to global sea level rise, largely driven by increased surface meltwater runoff from the ablation zone, i.e., areas of the ice sheet where annual mass losses exceed gains. This small but critically important area of the ice sheet has expanded in size by {\~{}}50{\%} since the early 1960s, and satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for monitoring the physical processes that influence its surface mass balance. This review synthesizes key remote sensing methods and scientific findings from satellite remote sensing of the Greenland Ice Sheet ablation zone, covering progress in (1) radar altimetry, (2) laser (lidar) altimetry, (3) gravimetry, (4) multispectral optical imagery, and (5) microwave and thermal imagery. Physical characteristics and quantities examined include surface elevation change, gravimetric mass balance, reflectance, albedo, and mapping of surface melt extent and glaciological facies and zones. The review concludes that future progress will benefit most from methods that combine multi-sensor, multi-wavelength, and cross-platform datasets designed to discriminate the widely varying surface processes in the ablation zone. Specific examples include fusing laser altimetry, radar altimetry, and optical stereophotogrammetry to enhance spatial measurement density, cross-validate surface elevation change, and diagnose radar elevation bias; employing dual-frequency radar, microwave scatterometry, or combining radar and laser altimetry to map seasonal snow depth; fusing optical imagery, radar imagery, and microwave scatterometry to discriminate between snow, liquid water, refrozen meltwater, and bare ice near the equilibrium line altitude; combining optical reflectance with laser altimetry to map supraglacial lake, stream, and crevasse bathymetry; and monitoring the inland migration of snowlines, surface melt extent, and supraglacial hydrologic features.},
